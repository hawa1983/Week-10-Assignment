cn29,"`` Bastards '' , he would say , `` all I did was put a beat to that Vivaldi stuff , and the first chair clobbered me '' !",1
cn29,"Since then , and since the pure grain had gotten him divorced from every decent -- and even indecent -- group from Greenwich Village to the Embarcadero , he had become a sucker-rolling freight-jumper .",2
cn29,"`` There ain't nothin' faster , or lonelier , or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace '' , Feathertop would say .",3
cn29,"`` The accommodations may not be the poshest , but man !",4
cn29,"There ain't nobody askin' for your ticket stub , neither '' .",5
cn29,"He had been conning the freights for a long , long time now .",6
cn29,"Ever since the hooch , and the trouble with the Quartet , and Midge and the child .",7
cn29,Ever since all that .,8
cn29,It had been a very long time that had no form and no end .,9
cn29,He was -- as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own -- riding the dark train out .,10
cn29,Out and out and never to return again .,11
cn29,"Till one day the last freight had been jumped , the last pint had been killed , the last beat had been rapped .",12
cn29,That was the day it ended .,13
cn29,"The freight car was cold , early in the morning .",14
cn29,"He was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks , the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina .",15
cn29,"He held his elbows away from his body , and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tune-belly .",16
cn29,"The train slowed at a road crossing , and the big door slid open ; ; at first gratingly , caught by grains of corn -- then with a clash into its slot .",17
cn29,The boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor .,18
cn29,"She pulled her legs up under her , to rise , her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs , and Feathertop's music pfffted away .",19
cn29,"`` Now that is a very nice , a very nice '' , he murmured to himself , back in his corner .",20
cn29,"A little thing , but the right twist for the action that counted .",21
cn29,"Hot , that was the word , hot !",22
cn29,"Hair like a morning-frightened sparrow's wings , with the sun shining down over them .",23
cn29,"A poet , yet !",24
cn29,"His thoughts for the swanlike neck , the full , high breasts , the slim waist , and the long legs were less than poetic , however .",25
cn29,Zingggg-O !,26
cn29,"Then the boy straight-armed himself up , twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting .",27
cn29,"He was less to see , but Feathertop took him in , too , just to keep the records straight .",28
cn29,"Curly hair , high cheekbones , wide gnomelike mouth , a pair of drummer's blocky hands , and a body that said well , maybe I can wrestle you for ten minutes -- but then I'm finished .",29
cn29,"`` We made it , Cappy '' , the chick said .",30
cn29,"`` Yeah , seems so , don't it '' , the boy laughed , hugging her close .",31
cn29,`` Ah-ah '' !,32
cn29,"Feathertop interrupted , standing up , brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants .",33
cn29,`` None of that .,34
cn29,We run a respectable house here '' .,35
cn29,"They whirled and saw him , standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall .",36
cn29,"He was big , and filthy , and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes .",37
cn29,He held the black plastic kazoo lightly .,38
cn29,"`` Come sit '' , said Feathertop , motioning them toward him .",39
cn29,`` That crap is softer over here '' .,40
cn29,"The girl smiled , and started forward .",41
cn29,"The boy yanked her back hard , tugging her off her feet , and gathered her into the crook of his arm .",42
cn29,"`` Now stay with me , Kitty '' , he snapped irritably .",43
cn29,`` I vowed to take care of you -- and that's what I'm gonna do .,44
cn29,We don't know this guy '' .,45
cn29,"`` Oooo , square bit '' , Feathertop screwed his face up .",46
cn29,This guy was strictly from Outsville .,47
cn29,But nowhere !,48
cn29,`` What is with this vow jazz '' ?,49
cn29,"Feathertop inquired , lounging against the freight's vibrating wall .",50
cn29,"`` We -- we eloped '' , Cappy said .",51
cn29,His head came up and he said it defiantly .,52
cn29,"`` Well , congratulations '' .",53
cn29,Feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand .,54
cn29,These two were going to be easy pickins .,55
cn29,"They couldn't have much dough , but then none of the freight-bums Feathertop rolled had much .",56
cn29,"And besides , the chick had a little something the others didn't have .",57
cn29,That was gonna be fun collecting !,58
cn29,But not just yet .,59
cn29,Feathertop was a connoisseur .,60
cn29,He liked to savor his meat before he tasted it .,61
cn29,"`` Come sit '' , he repeated , motioning to the piled hay bags , over the pig leavings .",62
cn29,"`` I'm just a poor ex-jazz man , name of -- uh -- Boyd Smith '' .",63
cn29,He grinned at them wolfishly .,64
cn29,"`` That ain't your name , Mister '' , the boy accused .",65
cn29,`` And you know -- you're right '' !,66
cn29,Feathertop aimed a finger at him .,67
cn29,"`` Oh , come on , Cappy '' , the girl chided .",68
cn29,`` He's okay .,69
cn29,He's a nice guy '' .,70
cn29,"She started to move toward the hay bags , dragging the reluctant Cappy behind her .",71
cn29,"Feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim , trim legs as she walked to the bags , and tucked them beneath her , smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle .",72
cn29,"He cleared his throat ; ; it had been a long , hot while since he'd seen anything as nice as this within grabbin' distance .",73
cn29,"He had it all doped , of course .",74
cn29,"Slug the kid , grab his dough -- at least enough to get to Philadelphia -- and then have a rockin' ball with the doll .",75
cn29,Hmm -- diddle !,76
cn29,"`` Where'd you come from , Mr. -- uh -- Mr. Smith '' ?",77
cn29,Kitty inquired politely .,78
cn29,`` Where from '' ?,79
cn29,He mused .,80
cn29,`` Out .,81
cn29,I been riding train for a ways now '' .,82
cn29,"They lapsed into silence , and the freight wallowed up a hill , scooted down the other side , shaking and clanking to itself .",83
cn29,"After a while , Kitty murmured something to Cappy , and he held her close , answering , `` We'll just have to wait till we pull into Philly , honey '' .",84
cn29,"`` What's the matter , she wanna go the bathroom '' ?",85
cn29,Ernie found it immensely funny .,86
cn29,"The boy scowled at him , and the girl looked shocked .",87
cn29,`` No !,88
cn29,"Certainly not , I mean , no that isn't what I said '' !",89
cn29,She snapped at him .,90
cn29,`` I only said I was hungry .,91
cn29,We haven't had anything to eat all day '' .,92
cn29,"Joviality suffused Feathertop Ernie Cargill's voice as he reached behind him , pulling out a battered carpet bag , with leather handles .",93
cn29,"`` Whyn't ya say so , fellow travelers !",94
cn29,"Why , we got dinner right here .",95
cn29,"C'mon , buddy , help me set up the kitchen and we'll have food in a minute or two '' .",96
cn29,"Cappy looked wary , but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty ex-musician to the center of the refuse-littered boxcar .",97
cn29,Ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag .,98
cn29,"He took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal , a deep pot of thin metal , some sheets of newspaper , a book of matches and a wrinkled and many-times folded piece of tin foil with holes in it .",99
cn29,"He put the charcoal in the pot , lit the paper with the matches , and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot .",100
cn29,"`` A charcoal pit , man '' , he said , indicating the slightly-smoking makeshift brazier .",101
cn29,"`` Fan it '' , he told Cappy , handing him a sheet of newspaper .",102
cn29,"`` Yeah , but what're we gonna eat ?",103
cn29,Charcoal '' ?,104
cn29,"`` Fella '' , Ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man , `` you try my ever-lovin' patience '' .",105
cn29,He reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners .,106
cn29,"`` Hot dogs , man .",107
cn29,"Not the greatest , but they stick to your belly insides '' .",108
cn29,"He ripped down the cellophane carefully , and laid three dogs on the tin foil .",109
cn29,Almost immediately they began to sizzle .,110
cn29,He looked up and grinned .,111
cn29,"`` A Kroger's self-serve '' , he explained .",112
cn29,`` I self-served '' .,113
cn29,"When they had licked the last of the wieners' taste from their fingers , they settled back , and Cappy offered Ernie a cigarette .",114
cn29,"Nice kid , Ernie thought , too bad .",115
cn29,"`` How come you're riding the rods , kids like you '' ?",116
cn29,Ernie asked .,117
cn29,"Cappy looked down at his wide hands , and did not reply .",118
cn29,"But surprisingly , Kitty's face came up and she said , `` My father .",119
cn29,He didn't want us to get married .,120
cn29,So we ran away '' .,121
cn29,`` Why didn't he want you to get hitched '' ?,122
cn29,This time even she did not answer .,123
cn29,"She looked down at her hands , too .",124
cn29,"After a few seconds , she said , `` Dad didn't like Cappy .",125
cn29,It was my fault '' .,126
cn29,Cappy's head came around sharply .,127
cn29,"`` Your fault , hell !",128
cn29,It was all my fault .,129
cn29,If I'd been careful it never woulda '' -- he stopped abruptly .,130
cn29,Ernie's eyebrows went up .,131
cn29,`` What's the matter '' ?,132
cn29,"The girl still did not raise her eyes , but she added simply , `` I'm pregnant '' .",133
cn29,Cappy raged at himself .,134
cn29,"`` Oh he was stupid , her old man !",135
cn29,"You never heard nothin' like it : Kitty's gonna go have an abortion , and Kitty's gonna go away to a convent , and Kitty's this and Kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin' , y'know '' ?",136
cn29,Ernie nodded .,137
cn29,This was a slightly different matter .,138
cn29,"He remembered Midge , and the child .",139
cn29,"But that had been a time before all this , a time he didn't think about .",140
cn29,A time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out .,141
cn29,But these kids weren't like him .,142
cn29,Oh crap !,143
cn29,"He thought , Pull out of it , old son .",144
cn29,These are just another couple of characters to roll .,145
cn29,"What they got , you get .",146
cn29,Now forget all this other .,147
cn29,`` Wanna drink '' ?,148
cn29,"Ernie offered , taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket .",149
cn29,`` Yeah .,150
cn29,Now that you offer '' .,151
cn29,The answer came from the open door of the boxcar .,152
cn29,"From the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside , as the train had slowed on the grade .",153
cn29,Ernie stared at the man .,154
cn29,He was big .,155
cn29,"Real big , with shoulders out to here , and hair all over him like a grizzly .",156
cn29,"Road gang , Ernie thought .",157
cn29,"`` You gonna give me a drink , fella '' ?",158
cn29,"The big man asked again , taking a step into the boxcar .",159
cn29,Ernie hesitated a moment .,160
cn29,This character could break him in half .,161
cn29,"`` Sure '' , he said , and lifted the pint to his own lips .",162
cn29,He guzzled down three-quarters of the strong home-blend and proffered the remainder .,163
cn29,"The man stalked toward them , his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring .",164
cn29,"He took the bottle with undue belligerence , and making sucking noises with his thick lips , drained it completely .",165
cn29,"He threw his head back , closed his eyes , and belched ferociously .",166
cn29,"He belched again , and opening his eyes , threw the bottle out the open door .",167
cn29,"`` Well , now '' , he said , and reached into his pocket .",168
cn29,`` I didn't know I was gonna have company in this car '' .,169
cn29,"`` We're going to Philadelphia '' , Kitty said , pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more .",170
cn29,"`` No , I don't think so '' , said the big man , and it was the final clincher for Ernie .",171
cn29,"He had suspected this guy was trouble , and now he was sure of it .",172
cn29,"`` Maybe you and me will , girlie , but these two ain't goin' nowhere '' .",173
cn29,"He advanced on them , and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car .",174
cn29,"Ernie was screaming inside himself : No , damn you , you ain't gonna take my meal ticket away from me !",175
cn29,"The newcomer stalked toward them , and Kitty shied back , her hand to her mouth .",176
cn29,"Her scream split up the silence of the car , accompanied by the rattling of the freight , and then Cappy came off the floor , his legs driving him hard .",177
cn29,The kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump !,178
cn29,And carried him backward in a footballer's tackle .,179
cn29,They went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs .,180
cn29,"The kid showed for an instant , and his arm was cocked back .",181
cn29,"The fist went down into the pile of flesh , and Ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go , `` Aaawww '' !",182
cn29,"Then they were tumbling again , and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier , and came up with a vicious switchblade .",183
cn29,He held the knife aloft an instant -- an instant enough to press the stud .,184
cn29,The blade came out with a snick !,185
cn29,"He fisted the knife overhand , and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat .",186
cn29,Kitty screamed insanely and her face was white .,187
cn29,"She grabbed at Feathertop's sleeve and shrieked , `` Help him !",188
cn29,Help him !,189
cn29,Do something '' !,190
cn17,"I guided her to the divan , turned off the TV , faced her .",191
cn17,"She sat quietly , staring at me from the wide eyes .",192
cn17,And what eyes they were .,193
cn17,"Big and dark , a melting , golden brown .",194
cn17,"Eyes like hot honey , eyes that sizzled .",195
cn17,"Plus flawless skin , smooth brow and cheeks , lips that looked as if you could get a shock from them .",196
cn17,"It was a disturbingly familiar face , too , but I couldn't remember where we had met .",197
cn17,"I said , `` Do we know each other , Miss '' ?",198
cn17,"`` No , I remembered reading about you in the papers and that you lived here , and when it happened all I could think of was '' -- This time she stopped the rush of words herself .",199
cn17,`` I'm sorry .,200
cn17,Shall I go on '' ?,201
cn17,She smiled .,202
cn17,It was her first smile .,203
cn17,But worth waiting for .,204
cn17,`` Sure '' .,205
cn17,I said .,206
cn17,"`` But one word at a time , O.K. ''",207
cn17,"She was still hugging the stained coat around her , so I said , `` Relax , let me take your things .",208
cn17,"Would you like a drink , or coffee '' ?",209
cn17,"`` No , thanks '' .",210
cn17,"She stood up , pulled the coat from her shoulders and started to slide it off , then let out a high-pitched scream and I let out a low-pitched , wobbling sound like a muffler blowing out .",211
cn17,She was wearing nothing beneath the coat .,212
cn17,"She jerked the coat back on and squeezed it around her again , but not soon enough .",213
cn17,"There had been a good second or two during which my muffler had been blowing out , and now I was certain I'd seen her somewhere before .",214
cn17,`` I forgot '' !,215
cn17,She yelped .,216
cn17,"`` Oh , do forgive me .",217
cn17,I'm sorry '' !,218
cn17,`` I forgive '' -- `` That's what started all the trouble in the first place .,219
cn17,"Oh , dear , I'm all unstrung '' .",220
cn17,"`` You and me both , dear .",221
cn17,Haven't we haven't I seen you .,222
cn17,"I mean , surely we've '' -- `` You may have seen me on TV '' , she said .",223
cn17,`` I've done several filmed commercials for '' -- Then it hit me .,224
cn17,`` Zing '' !,225
cn17,I cried .,226
cn17,"`` Why , yes .",227
cn17,And you recognized me '' ?,228
cn17,"`` Yes , indeed .",229
cn17,"In fact , I was watching you on that little seventeen-inch screen when you rang my bell .",230
cn17,"Man , you rang -- it was in color , too , Miss , and Miss ?",231
cn17,"What's your name , anyway ?",232
cn17,"Ah , you were splendid '' .",233
cn17,I sat by her on the divan .,234
cn17,`` Splendid .,235
cn17,In a waterfall and all that '' .,236
cn17,`` That's the last one we did .,237
cn17,That was a fun one '' .,238
cn17,`` I'll bet .,239
cn17,"It was fun for me , all right .",240
cn17,"I don't mean to pry , but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubbles ?",241
cn17,I mean : Is advertising honest ?,242
cn17,`` It depends on who does it .,243
cn17,I never wear anything at all .,244
cn17,"It wouldn't -- wouldn't seem fair , somehow '' .",245
cn17,`` I couldn't agree with you more '' .,246
cn17,"`` I really do have something important to tell you , Mr. Scott .",247
cn17,About the murder '' .,248
cn17,`` Murder ?,249
cn17,"Oh , yeah '' , I said .",250
cn17,`` Tell me about the murder '' .,251
cn17,She told me .,252
cn17,"Zing was the creation of two men , Louis Thor and Bill Blake , partners in zing !",253
cn17,", Inc. .",254
cn17,"They'd peddled the soap virtually alone , and without much success , until about a year ago , when -- with the addition of `` SX-21 '' to their secret formula and the inauguration of a high-powered advertising campaign -- sales had soared practically into orbit .",255
cn17,"Their product had been endorsed by Good Housekeeping , the A.M.A.",256
cn17,", and the Veterinary Journal , among other repositories of higher wisdom , and before much longer if you didn't have a cake of their soap in the john , even your best friends would think you didn't bathe .",257
cn17,"My lovely caller -- Joyce Holland was her name -- had previously done three filmed commercials for zing , and this evening , the fourth , a super production , had been filmed at the home of Louis Thor .",258
cn17,"The water in Thor's big swimming pool had been covered with a blanket of thick , foamy soapsuds -- fashioned , of course , from zing -- Joyce had dived from the board into the pool , then swirled and cavorted in her luxurious `` bath '' while cameras rolled .",259
cn17,"The finished -- and drastically cut -- product would begin with a hazy longshot of Joyce entering the suds , then bursting above the pool's surface clad in layers of lavender lather , and I had a hunch this item was going to sell tons and tons of soap ; ; even to clean men and boys .",260
cn17,"Joyce went on , `` When we'd finished , Lou -- Mr. Thor -- asked me to stay a little longer .",261
cn17,"He wanted a few stills for magazine ads , he said .",262
cn17,"Everybody left and I stayed in the pool , then Lou came back alone and leaped into the pool too .",263
cn17,And he didn't have any clothes on '' .,264
cn17,`` He didn't '' !,265
cn17,"`` Yes , he didn't .",266
cn17,"Did , I mean '' .",267
cn17,She paused .,268
cn17,"`` Did leap into the pool , and didn't have anything on .",269
cn17,"Anyway , it was evident what he had in mind '' .",270
cn17,"`` You got away , didn't you '' ?",271
cn17,`` Yes .,272
cn17,"He caught up with me once and grabbed me , but I was all covered with zing -- it's very slippery , you know '' .",273
cn17,`` I didn't know .,274
cn17,I wouldn't have the stuff in the house .,275
cn17,But I'm pleased to hear '' -- `` So I just scooted out of his clutches .,276
cn17,"I swam like mad , got out of the pool , grabbed my robe , and ran to the car .",277
cn17,"The keys were still in it , and I was miles away before I remembered that my clothes and purse and everything were still in the little cabana where I'd changed '' .",278
cn17,"She'd driven around for a while , Joyce said , then , thinking Louis Thor would have calmed down by that time , she'd gone back to his home on Bryn Mawr Drive , parked in front , and walked toward the pool .",279
cn17,"While several yards from it , still concealed by the shrubbery , she'd seen two men on her left at the pool's edge .",280
cn17,"She went on : `` A man was holding onto Lou , holding him up .",281
cn17,"Maybe Lou was only unconscious , but right then I thought he must be dead .",282
cn17,"The man shoved him into the water , then ran past the cabana .",283
cn17,There's a walk there that goes out to Quebec Drive .,284
cn17,"I was so scared well , I just ran to my car and came here '' .",285
cn17,`` You know who the other man was '' ?,286
cn17,"`` No , I never did see his face .",287
cn17,"I didn't get a good look at him at all , his back was to me , and I was so scared It was just somebody in a man's suit .",288
cn17,But I'm sure the other one was Lou '' .,289
cn17,"What Joyce wanted me to do was go to Thor's house and `` do whatever detectives do '' , and get her clothes -- and handbag containing her identification .",290
cn17,"She realized I'd have to notify the police , but fervently hoped I could avoid mentioning her name .",291
cn17,"Her impact in the zing commercials had led to her being considered for an excellent part in an upcoming TV series , Underwater Western Eye , a documentary-type show to be sponsored by Oatnut Grits .",292
cn17,"But if Joyce got involved in murder or salacious scandal , the role would probably go to the sponsor's wife , Mrs. Oatnut Grits .",293
cn17,Or at least not to Joyce .,294
cn17,"`` And I so want the part '' , she said .",295
cn17,"`` The commercials have just been for money , there hasn't been any real incentive for me to do them , but in Underwater Western Eye I'd have a chance to act .",296
cn17,I could show what I can do '' .,297
cn17,"As far as I was concerned , she had already and had dandily shown what she could do .",298
cn17,"But I promised Joyce I would mention her name , if at all , only as a last resort .",299
cn17,"Seeming much relieved , she smiled one of those worth-waiting-for smiles , and I smiled all the way into the bedroom .",300
cn17,"There I got my Colt Special and shoulder harness , slipped my coat on , and went back into the front room .",301
cn17,Joyce squirmed a little on the divan .,302
cn17,"`` I'm starting to itch '' , she said .",303
cn17,`` Itch '' ?,304
cn17,"`` Yes , I'm still all covered with that soap .",305
cn17,"I was loaded with suds when I ran away , and I haven't had a chance to wash it off .",306
cn17,"Mmmm , it sure itches '' .",307
cn17,"`` You might as well wait here while I'm gone , so you can use my shower if you'd like '' .",308
cn17,"`` Oh , I'd love to '' .",309
cn17,"I showed her the shower and tub , and she said , smiling , `` If you really don't mind , I think I'll get clean in the shower , then soak for a few minutes in your tub .",310
cn17,That always relaxes me .,311
cn17,Doesn't it you '' ?,312
cn17,`` Only when I do it '' .,313
cn17,I shook my head .,314
cn17,One of my virtues or vices is a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effects and glorious living color .,315
cn17,"`` Soak as long as you want , Joyce .",316
cn17,It'll probably be at least an hour or two before I can check back with you .,317
cn17,"So you'll have everything all to yourself , doggone '' I looked at my watch .",318
cn17,Ten after nine .,319
cn17,"Time to go , I supposed .",320
cn17,"`` Well , goodbye '' , I said .",321
cn17,`` Goodbye .,322
cn17,You'd better hurry '' .,323
cn17,"`` Oh , you can count on that '' .",324
cn17,She smiled slightly .,325
cn17,Softly .,326
cn17,Warmly .,327
cn17,`` Don't hurry too much .,328
cn17,I'll be soaking for at least half an hour '' .,329
cn17,That was all she said .,330
cn17,But suddenly those hot-honey eyes seemed to have everything but swarms of bees in them .,331
cn17,"However , when there's a job to be done , I'm a monstrosity of grim determination , I like to think .",332
cn17,I spun about and clattered through the front room to the door .,333
cn17,"As I went out , I could hear water pouring in the shower .",334
cn17,Hot water .,335
cn17,She wouldn't be taking a cold shower .,336
cn17,"Hell , she couldn't .",337
cn17,"Bryn Mawr Drive is only two or three miles from the Spartan , and it took me less than five minutes to get there .",338
cn17,"But the scene was not the quiet , calm scene I'd expected .",339
cn17,"Four cars were parked at the curb , and two of them were police radio cars .",340
cn17,Lights blazed in the big house and surrounding grounds .,341
cn17,I followed a shrubbery-lined gravel path alongside the house to the pool .,342
cn17,"Two uniformed officers , a couple of plain-clothesmen I knew , and two other men stood on a gray cement area next to the pool on my left .",343
cn17,"At the pool's far end was the little cabana Joyce had mentioned , and on the water's surface floated scattered lavender patches of limp-looking lather .",344
cn17,"A few yards beyond the group of men , a man's nude body lay face down on a patch of thick green dichondra .",345
cn17,"Lieutenant Rawlins , one of the plain-clothesmen , spotted me and said , `` Hi , Shell '' , and walked toward me .",346
cn17,`` How'd you hear about this one '' ?,347
cn17,"I grinned , but ignored the question .",348
cn17,He didn't push it ; ; Rawlins worked out of Central Homicide and we'd been friends for years .,349
cn17,He filled me in .,350
cn17,"A call to the police had been placed from here a couple of minutes after nine P.M. , and the first police car had arrived two or three minutes after that -- 10 minutes ago now .",351
cn17,"Present at the scene -- in addition to the dead man , who was indeed Louis Thor -- had been Thor's partner Bill Blake , and Antony Rose , an advertising agency executive who handled the zing account .",352
cn17,"Neither of them , I understood , had been present at the filming session earlier .",353
cn17,`` What were they doing here '' ?,354
cn17,I asked Rawlins .,355
cn17,"`` They were supposed to meet Thor at nine PM for a conference concerning the ad campaign for their soap , a new angle based on this SX-21 stuff '' .",356
cn17,"`` Yeah , I've heard more about SX-21 than space exploration lately .",357
cn17,What is the gunk '' ?,358
cn17,`` How would I know ?,359
cn17,It's a secret .,360
cn17,That was the new advertising angle -- something about a Lloyd's of London policy to insure the secrecy of the secret ingredient .,361
cn17,"Actually , only two men know what the formula is , Blake and '' -- He stopped and looked at Thor's body .",362
cn17,"I said , `` O.K.",363
cn17,", so now only Blake knows .",364
cn17,"How's it strike you , foul or fair '' ?",365
cn17,`` Can't say yet .,366
cn17,Deputy coroner says it looks like he sucked in a big pile of those thick suds and strangled on 'em .,367
cn17,"The PM might show he drowned instead , but that's what the once-over-lightly gives us .",368
cn17,"Accident , murder , suicide -- take your pick '' .",369
cn17,`` I'll pick murder .,370
cn17,Anything else '' ?,371
cn17,"`` According to Rose , he arrived here a couple minutes before nine and spotted Thor in the water , got a hooked pole from the pool-equipment locker and started hauling him out .",372
cp24,There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot .,373
cp24,The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop .,374
cp24,For a few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out .,375
cp24,"Then , in the fifth , Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field .",376
cp24,"Eddie Lee , Riverside's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him .",377
cp24,Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay .,378
cp24,Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil .,379
cp24,`` Third !,380
cp24,Third base '' !,381
cp24,Eddie shouted .,382
cp24,Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on third base .,383
cp24,Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag .,384
cp24,But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late .,385
cp24,He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face .,386
cp24,`` You bastard '' !,387
cp24,The Anniston catcher screamed .,388
cp24,He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches .,389
cp24,Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher .,390
cp24,"This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar .",391
cp24,The fighters were separated in a few minutes .,392
cp24,The game was resumed .,393
cp24,But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now .,394
cp24,When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout .,395
cp24,"Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink .",396
cp24,"Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field .",397
cp24,He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began .,398
cp24,"`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' !",399
cp24,Mike yelled to the catcher .,400
cp24,`` You're in for trouble '' .,401
cp24,The Anniston catcher did not reply with words .,402
cp24,He simply turned to Mike and smiled .,403
cp24,This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard .,404
cp24,"So help me God , I'll get him '' .",405
cp24,Phil Rossoff said : `` Why don't you leave him alone '' ?,406
cp24,"`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said .",407
cp24,Phil shrugged .,408
cp24,"He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble .",409
cp24,Maybe the answer was in his eyes .,410
cp24,When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips .,411
cp24,In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head .,412
cp24,By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home .,413
cp24,The left fielder threw and it was a good one .,414
cp24,But Mike had no chance of being tagged .,415
cp24,The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate .,416
cp24,"All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher .",417
cp24,Both fell heavily to the ground .,418
cp24,Only Mike got to his feet .,419
cp24,"He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back .",420
cp24,The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field .,421
cp24,They poured water over their catcher's face .,422
cp24,He did not move .,423
cp24,Then the manager called for a doctor .,424
cp24,The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer .,425
cp24,"Then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room .",426
cp24,"Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching .",427
cp24,When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' .,428
cp24,"Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench .",429
cp24,The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout .,430
cp24,He was followed by four of his men .,431
cp24,It began to look as if something was going to happen .,432
cp24,Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer .,433
cp24,Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side .,434
cp24,No one said a word .,435
cp24,The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike .,436
cp24,His face was flushed .,437
cp24,"`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering .",438
cp24,`` That was a rotten thing to do '' .,439
cp24,"`` For God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away .",440
cp24,"`` Stop it , will you ?",441
cp24,Tell your guys not to block the plate '' .,442
cp24,`` You didn't have to ram him '' .,443
cp24,`` That's what you say '' .,444
cp24,The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee .,445
cp24,It was a cold and calculated look .,446
cp24,He turned and went back across the field to his dugout .,447
cp24,"He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston .",448
cp24,The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat .,449
cp24,Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting .,450
cp24,The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head .,451
cp24,"Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him .",452
cp24,He arose slowly and brushed himself off .,453
cp24,He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again .,454
cp24,`` Hit the bum '' !,455
cp24,Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench .,456
cp24,"In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' .",457
cp24,`` Look at those bastards '' !,458
cp24,"Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said .",459
cp24,`` They're looking for trouble '' .,460
cp24,Mike was slow getting into the box this time .,461
cp24,When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in .,462
cp24,`` Listen '' !,463
cp24,He shouted to the pitcher .,464
cp24,`` One more and I'm coming out there '' !,465
cp24,`` I'll be waiting '' !,466
cp24,The pitcher yelled back .,467
cp24,Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat .,468
cp24,"He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now .",469
cp24,The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head .,470
cp24,"Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound .",471
cp24,The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan .,472
cp24,"They were both walking towards each other , unhurried .",473
cp24,Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field .,474
cp24,"In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog .",475
cp24,There was much shouting and screaming .,476
cp24,Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched .,477
cp24,Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together .,478
cp24,Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started .,479
cp24,"After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in .",480
cp24,"`` It's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight '' .",481
cp24,Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head .,482
cp24,Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil .,483
cp24,The other players were undressing quietly .,484
cp24,Eddie Lee had not come in yet .,485
cp24,Mike went over to Phil and stood over him .,486
cp24,`` Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ?,487
cp24,`` I didn't think it was necessary '' .,488
cp24,`` Well !,489
cp24,Now that's just fine !,490
cp24,You didn't think it was necessary '' .,491
cp24,Mike placed both his hands on his hips .,492
cp24,He pushed his jaw forward .,493
cp24,"`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' .",494
cp24,Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face .,495
cp24,"`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly .",496
cp24,"`` Nobody else did , either '' .",497
cp24,`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ?,498
cp24,`` I'm not trying to say anything '' .,499
cp24,"Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' !",500
cp24,And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around .,501
cp24,But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room .,502
cp24,"`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said .",503
cp24,Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door .,504
cp24,He sat down before Eddie's desk .,505
cp24,"`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly .",506
cp24,`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' .,507
cp24,Phil's eyes widened just a trifle .,508
cp24,"`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home .",509
cp24,You don't belong in professional baseball '' .,510
cp24,Phil had to clear his throat .,511
cp24,`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ?,512
cp24,"`` No '' , Eddie said .",513
cp24,`` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' .,514
cp24,Phil stood up .,515
cp24,`` Listen !,516
cp24,This is the second time . '',517
cp24,"`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said .",518
cp24,`` I'm not saying you're yellow .,519
cp24,I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' .,520
cp24,Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk .,521
cp24,"`` Now listen to me , Phil .",522
cp24,I'm not steering you wrong .,523
cp24,You haven't got the heart for baseball '' .,524
cp24,Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned .,525
cp24,Suddenly his voice grew hard .,526
cp24,`` What the hell do you think baseball is ?,527
cp24,"You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ?",528
cp24,Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short .,529
cp24,`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are .,530
cp24,I know you've got talent .,531
cp24,But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with .,532
cp24,"The heart , Phil .",533
cp24,"You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it '' .",534
cp24,"Dazed , Phil said : `` I don't get it .",535
cp24,"My batting average '' Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly .",536
cp24,`` What difference does your batting average make ?,537
cp24,Or your fielding average .,538
cp24,Or even the way you run bases .,539
cp24,I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it .,540
cp24,That's what I mean by no heart for the game .,541
cp24,Baseball's no cinch .,542
cp24,Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there .,543
cp24,He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on .,544
cp24,What the hell do you think baseball is ?,545
cp24,A sport ?,546
cp24,"It's a way of life , goddamit !",547
cp24,And you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' !,548
cp24,He's wrong !,549
cp24,Phil thought .,550
cp24,It's only his opinion .,551
cp24,There were other clubs in this league .,552
cp24,He stood up slowly .,553
cp24,He was a little pale and shaky .,554
cp24,His lips felt glued together .,555
cp24,"`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally .",556
cp24,Eddie nodded .,557
cp24,`` Okay .,558
cp24,You'll get your pay in the morning '' .,559
cp24,"Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right '' .",560
cp24,Phil shut the door behind him .,561
cp24,"Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes .",562
cp24,`` What happened '' ?,563
cp24,Frankie asked .,564
cp24,Phil said : `` I got my release '' .,565
cp24,`` You crazy '' ?,566
cp24,Phil shrugged .,567
cp24,`` What for '' ?,568
cp24,Phil sighed .,569
cp24,Frankie shook his head .,570
cp24,`` I don't get it '' .,571
cp24,"`` I don't know '' , Phil said .",572
cp24,They were silent for a few moments .,573
cp24,Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ?,574
cp24,Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again .,575
cp24,Phil took off one shoe and stared at it .,576
cp24,"`` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said .",577
cp24,"`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later .",578
cp24,The leagues are full of guys like that '' .,579
cp24,Phil was very quiet .,580
cp24,"`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ?",581
cp24,Phil did not answer .,582
cp24,`` Why not try another club '' ?,583
cp24,Phil looked up .,584
cp24,What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ?,585
cp24,"`` Springfield's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said .",586
cp24,`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' .,587
cp24,"He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that .",588
cp24,"`` Will you do it , Phil '' ?",589
cp24,`` Do what '' ?,590
cp24,`` Ask Whitey for a job '' .,591
cp24,Phil nodded .,592
cp24,"`` Sure '' , he said .",593
cp24,`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ?,594
cp24,Frankie nodded .,595
cp24,`` I'll speak to Whitey '' .,596
cp24,`` Atta boy '' .,597
cp24,"`` I'll talk to him , all right '' .",598
cp24,"`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said .",599
cp24,`` You'll get a job there .,600
cp24,He needs outfielders bad '' .,601
cp24,"`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said .",602
cp24,`` That's the way to talk .,603
cp24,What else did Eddie have to say '' ?,604
cp24,"`` Nothing '' , Phil said .",605
cr03,"Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise .",606
cr03,"How dared they demand to `` snoop '' in private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ?",607
cr03,"`` It is as though '' , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor , Manhattan Merry-go-round and Major Bowes shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie !",608
cr03,My impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis .,609
cr03,But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ?,610
cr03,"The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of `` Soak the rich ' !",611
cr03,"After an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict , was `` stung '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings .",612
cr03,"I was also publicly reprimanded , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New Republic , The New Yorker , Time and The Christian Science Monitor .",613
cr03,It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional .,614
cr03,The litigation was costly and seemingly endless .,615
cr03,"I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court ( 1937 ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me .",616
cr03,"Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me !",617
cr03,"I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief .",618
cr03,But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case !,619
cr03,My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' .,620
cr03,"Again , my name was on all the front pages .",621
cr03,"I was , it seemed , persona non grata in every quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence .",622
cr03,"As Charles Evans Hughes said , `` Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant '' .",623
cr03,Albert Einstein was quoted as saying : `` The workings of the woman's mind amaze me '' .,624
cr03,Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding '' .,625
cr03,"Heywood Broun wrote : `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula '' , and even F.D.R.",626
cr03,"had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh '' .",627
cr03,"Not only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow .",628
cr03,"Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good '' .",629
cr03,"My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor '' !",630
cr03,Traitor indeed !,631
cr03,"I point now with pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American Activities , the Minute Women , the Economic Council and other such notable `` watchdog '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism '' against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F.D.R.",632
cr03,"employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief '' checks .",633
cr03,"Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period .",634
cr03,Could it do otherwise ?,635
cr03,"Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled .",636
cr03,Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar '' winning performances .,637
cr03,"I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe .",638
cr03,"Having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all .",639
cr03,"Never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss Poitrine's co-star and `` helpmate '' had never learned his part .",640
cr03,"Each time Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into `` sulks '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the `` set '' for the rest of the day .",641
cr03,"As for his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` salted away '' .",642
cr03,"It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic Club .",643
cr03,Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw .,644
cr03,( But that is another story . ),645
cr03,"As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing .",646
cr03,"More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu .",647
cr03,"And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children !",648
cr03,"Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband .",649
cr03,"`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' .",650
cr03,Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter .,651
cr03,I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around .,652
cr03,"Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow .",653
cr03,"( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory .",654
cr03,It almost always works out for the best . ),655
cr03,"Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I cannot say .",656
cr03,"With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse .",657
cr03,"The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant ; ; a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could .",658
cr03,These are but a sampling of the insults I endured .,659
cr03,"As Mrs. Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys ?",660
cr03,"As Letch's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering .",661
cr03,"Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it .",662
cr03,"Our last joint venture , Sainted Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish .",663
cr03,"As I was playing Mother Cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me .",664
cr03,"But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini .",665
cr03,And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ?,666
cr03,"Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ?",667
cr03,Did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually -- or even at all ?,668
cr03,He did not !,669
cr03,The `` shooting '' went on for eight months !,670
cr03,"Most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies '' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club .",671
cr03,"Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting .",672
cr03,"He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general .",673
cr03,"By the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother Cabrini .",674
cr03,"Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable .",675
cr03,Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood '' .,676
cr03,But it was small consolation .,677
cr03,"In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment .",678
cr03,( An actor must have discipline . ),679
cr03,"The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved .",680
cr03,"It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther , of all things !",681
cr03,It was a disaster !,682
cr03,"In clothes , Letch simply did not project .",683
cr03,He was laughed off the screen .,684
cr03,"At the same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac .",685
cr03,"It was a `` potboiler '' made on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal .",686
cr03,"My heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career .",687
cr03,"( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . )",688
cr03,Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before .,689
cr03,"I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me .",690
cr03,"`` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , I said .",691
cr03,`` What is Letch interested in '' ?,692
cr03,"`` Bookies , booze and babes '' , Momma said bluntly .",693
cr03,"Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference .",694
cr03,"`` I can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said .",695
cp06,"How , he wondered , does one enjoy one's spare time ?",696
cp06,He considered some interesting excursion but he was on the road every day from dawn to dusk .,697
cp06,"Then there was exercise , boating and hiking , which was not only good for you but also made you more virile : the thought of strenuous activity left him exhausted .",698
cp06,"Perhaps golf , with a fashionable companion -- but he'd lost his clubs , hadn't played in years .",699
cp06,"There was swimming over at the Riverside Hotel , but his skin was so white he looked like the bottom of a frog .",700
cp06,"Perhaps a packing trip into the Sierras , let his beard grow -- but that was too stark .",701
cp06,"I could , he thought , take a long walk -- but where ?",702
cp06,The telephone rang .,703
cp06,"`` You missed it '' , Buzz's voice said , `` You should have gone over to the Pagan Room with us .",704
cp06,Wow .,705
cp06,"Strippers , but scrumptious , and Toodle Williams and her all-lesbian band '' .",706
cp06,"`` Hi , Buzz '' , Owen said .",707
cp06,`` I went over to the Willows and dropped two notes '' .,708
cp06,"`` Tough '' , Buzz said , `` Listen , we're having a stag dinner over at the Pagan Room on Friday .",709
cp06,Imagine a stag dinner with Toodle Williams '' .,710
cp06,He laughed and laughed .,711
cp06,"Owen wanted to be pleasant because Buzz worked the territory next to his , but he hadn't come to Reno for stag dinners .",712
cp06,"`` Thanks '' , Owen said , `` but Friday is a long way off and anything can happen '' .",713
cp06,Buzz was a tireless instigator who never let his victims rest .,714
cp06,"When Owen was finally rid of him , there was a timid rap at the door .",715
cp06,"`` Yes '' , Owen called out .",716
cp06,`` Yes '' ?,717
cp06,"`` I'm Mrs. Gertrude Parker '' , a soft voice explained , `` And I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes , please '' .",718
cp06,"Ahah , he thought , a lush divorcee at last .",719
cp06,Probably saw me in the lobby .,720
cp06,"He was disappointed to find a nervous , scrawny woman with a big hat standing at the door .",721
cp06,She frowned at his green pajamas with the yellow moons .,722
cp06,`` How do you do '' ?,723
cp06,"She said , semi-professionally .",724
cp06,`` Our church is sponsoring a group of very courageous women up in Alaska .,725
cp06,We call them lay-sisters and they go among the Eskimos making friends and bringing the light .,726
cp06,They're up there in that freezing climate and all of us have to try and help them '' .,727
cp06,`` Oh '' ?,728
cp06,"`` You see '' , she said , looking past him into the room , where the highball glasses sparkled dully in the bright light , `` you and I can't understand the many hardships they have to undergo '' .",729
cp06,`` Why is that '' ?,730
cp06,She apparently wasn't satisfied with his reaction .,731
cp06,"Smug , Owen thought , smug and sappy .",732
cp06,There was a slight nervous twitch in the region of her left eye .,733
cp06,"It gave her a lewd , winking effect .",734
cp06,`` Have you ever tried to reason with an Eskimo '' ?,735
cp06,"She asked , winking wildly .",736
cp06,`` They are a very difficult group of people '' .,737
cp06,"`` I don't know much about them '' , Owen admitted , `` but I suppose they have their own religion and they probably resent outsiders coming in and telling them what to do and what not to do '' .",738
cp06,She smiled in a sickly-tolerant fashion .,739
cp06,"`` You know , that's very interesting .",740
cp06,People don't know how much they give away about themselves by remarks like that .,741
cp06,"The more canvassing I do , the more I note how far most people are from their personal God '' .",742
cp06,"Forebearing , Owen kept his peace .",743
cp06,What would happen next ?,744
cp06,"That she was out for a touch was certain , but when did she get to the pitch ?",745
cp06,"Several people passed in the hall and stared as he slowly retreated , trying to close the door a little , and she slowly leaned toward him and raised her voice .",746
cp06,`` How did you get by the desk '' ?,747
cp06,He asked curiously .,748
cp06,"`` I'm sure the hotel doesn't know you're wandering around the corridors , knocking on strangers' doors and talking down Eskimos '' .",749
cp06,"`` Oh , I just come once a week .",750
cp06,Every day I visit a different hotel .,751
cp06,I feel it's my duty .,752
cp06,"I do this work all on my own , because I understand the difficulties and I want to help these lay-sisters .",753
cp06,"Do you know these women go all through Alaska , and they don't have the proper facilities ?",754
cp06,They travel in pairs as much as a hundred-and-fifty miles a day '' .,755
cp06,`` Do you have any idea how far I travel every day ?,756
cp06,I have the whole Pacific Northwest '' .,757
cp06,Owen was aware he was getting overexcited but he couldn't help himself .,758
cp06,Mrs. Gertrude Parker drew back .,759
cp06,"`` That's hardly a Christian approach '' , she remonstrated .",760
cp06,`` You're in the secular world '' .,761
cp06,`` I didn't say it was Christian .,762
cp06,I don't think you'll find many active Christian salesmen .,763
cp06,"Not that religion isn't big business ; ; those bibles and prayer books make a lot of money for publishing houses , but they don't get top personnel .",764
cp06,Our key salesmen are in appliances and cosmetics '' .,765
cp06,"`` God , I take it , plays no part in this '' , she said waspishly .",766
cp06,"`` God doesn't have any appliance or cosmetics '' , he said heatedly before he caught himself .",767
cp06,It sounded silly ; ; why go on ?,768
cp06,More people were passing ; ; he had to find some way to close this impossible conversation .,769
cp06,"`` And whiskey '' , she said , smiling and blinking at the highball glasses .",770
cp06,`` Don't forget whiskey ; ; it's such a big seller '' .,771
cp06,"`` You know '' , he said , getting a grip on himself , `` I think you're going to have to excuse me .",772
cp06,I have an appointment '' .,773
cp06,"`` I can imagine '' , she said .",774
cp06,`` Probably down at the bar .,775
cp06,But what do you want to do about the lay-sisters ?,776
cp06,They must be freezing up there now .,777
cp06,Can't you help them '' ?,778
cp06,`` Leave a card or something .,779
cp06,I'll think it over '' .,780
cp06,"`` I have no card '' , she said bitterly .",781
cp06,`` You haven't been listening to what I've been telling you .,782
cp06,"I only hope my talking to you has helped you a little , anyway , because you need spiritual bucking-up '' .",783
cp06,"She looked crestfallen , as if he had somehow disappointed the whole human race .",784
cp06,"She stood indecisively for a moment , then walked down the hall ; ; he heard her knocking on another door .",785
cp06,It took him about fifteen minutes to calm himself ; ; then he realized he was hungry .,786
cp06,"He showered , shaved , dressed and went down to the dining room for breakfast .",787
cp06,On the way he stopped at the desk to receive his mail .,788
cp06,"There was a check from his company , and the usual enthusiastic bulletins on new lines they always issued .",789
cp06,"His lawyer had sent him a statement on his overdue alimony , and there was a letter from the Collector of Internal Revenue asking him to stop in his office and explain last year's exemptions .",790
cp06,"He ate breakfast in a sullen mood , but afterwards , when he walked out onto Virginia Street , he felt braced .",791
cp06,"He looked off to the crest of the Sierras , still white-topped ; ; the glisten of the Truckee River made a wide spangle .",792
cp06,"He felt suddenly elated , adventurous .",793
cp06,With any luck at all he could easily find a flowerpot .,794
cp06,"Although it was only three o'clock , he stopped in at the Golden Calf .",795
cp06,"The tables were all spinning , the dice rattling , the bar crowded .",796
cp06,"Just to test himself , he played roulette for quarters on his old combination , five and seventeen , and within an hour , he had won , surprisingly , twenty dollars .",797
cp06,"The way was opening up ; ; when the management brought around champagne , the breakfast settled its whirling around in his stomach .",798
cp06,The Golden Calf was dimly lit with shaded neon .,799
cp06,"There were more women than men in the place , but he couldn't find a flowerpot .",800
cp06,"They all had the hard look of gamblers who had stopped dreaming , who automatically turned the cards , hardly caring what showed up .",801
cp06,"The mural around the wall depicted early settlers in covered wagons , who appeared much more animated than the gamblers .",802
cp06,"The women had a bright shining expectancy as they leaned out from the wall and gazed splendidly into the distance , while the men were stern but hopeful .",803
cp06,"All , of course , except the Donner party who were bent on starving to death .",804
cp06,"`` I wonder if they did eat each other at the end '' , Owen mused .",805
cp06,"He sat down next to a heavily-upholstered blonde , but she was cleaned out in twenty minutes .",806
cp06,She sighed a dirty word and left .,807
cp06,Owen was surprised to see Mrs. Gertrude Parker playing the one-arm bandits that were cunningly arranged by the entrance .,808
cp06,"She sat down and played two slots at once , looking grim , as if bested by mechanical devices , and Owen felt sorry for the lay-sisters depending on her support .",809
cp06,A dried-up cowboy sat down next to him in the blonde's place .,810
cp06,He was a little more authentic than usual because he smelled slightly of the stables .,811
cp06,"`` What you need is a steady martingale '' , the cowboy announced after watching Owen play .",812
cp06,`` You can't build on your hit-and-miss five-seventeen '' .,813
cp06,`` What are you playing '' ?,814
cp06,Owen asked .,815
cp06,"`` I'm just logging '' , the cowboy explained .",816
cp06,"`` I keep all these plays in this little black book , and I watch over a twelve-hour period to find out what numbers are repeating .",817
cp06,But roulette's not my game .,818
cp06,I'm always trying to find a breaking table in blackjack .,819
cp06,"Incidentally , I'm pretty famous in these parts : I'm called The Wrangler '' .",820
cp06,`` Nice to know you .,821
cp06,Don't you have to spend any time on your ranch '' ?,822
cp06,"`` Well , of course I do .",823
cp06,"I'm with the Bar-H , pushing a horse called Sparky .",824
cp06,"He's my own horse , and what I collect from him I use on blackjack .",825
cp06,This Sparky can rack and single-foot and he's the fastest thing in Washoe County .,826
cp06,"I figure if I can get any kind of publicity campaign going , I'll land him on TV -- you know , one of those favorite horses for some Western hero .",827
cp06,"I once trained a horse for Hoot Gibson , but nothing like Sparky .",828
cp06,He's a pinto and he photographs wonderfully '' .,829
cp06,"Five came up while Owen was listening to The Wrangler and he neglected to play , a loss of ten dollars .",830
cp06,"This proved conclusively that The Wrangler was a jinx , so he walked on down to Hurrays , an even more glorified gambling den than the Golden Calf .",831
cp06,"When he looked in the back , Mrs. Gertrude Parker was marking keno cards .",832
cp06,His adventurous spirit had waned ; ; he studied the pistol exhibition that Hurrays featured as an added attraction .,833
cp06,"He ogled a long redhead with green eyes , but she was a shill with her money in front of her .",834
cp06,He had no great prejudice against shills ; ; it just seemed such a dry run .,835
cp06,There was no cash around ; ; everyone was flipping silver dollars .,836
cp06,The management discreetly withdrew the green stuff into the office and gave the customers chips or checks or premium points .,837
cp06,He read a special announcement whereby Hurrays would feature a special floorshow at three A.M. starring Adele ( The Body ) Brenner and fourteen glamorous schoolgirls .,838
cp06,"He wondered if he might bag a tourist , but they looked frightened of him .",839
cp06,"He passed two brides , both wearing orchids , and they made him feel a little sad .",840
cp06,Owen found Buzz watching chuck-a-luck .,841
cp06,Buzz had on a Hawaiian shirt and was carrying some sun-tan oil and dark glasses .,842
cp06,"He was shorter and fatter than Owen , who felt good standing next to him .",843
cp06,"`` We're all going over to Lake Tahoe and try our luck at Cal-Neva '' , Buzz explained , still instigating .",844
cp06,`` We ran into a guy at the Pagan Room who guarantees we can beat the wheel .,845
cp06,"He started out as a stickman , then became a pit boss until the Club found him crossroading .",846
cp06,He was knocking down checks at faro '' .,847
cp06,"`` I'm allergic to Tahoe '' , Owen explained .",848
cp06,`` Something about the pollen '' .,849
cp06,"`` Well , okay '' , Buzz said .",850
cp06,`` We'll see you around later '' .,851
cp06,"Owen went over to the crap table and the dice were hot , but he couldn't pyramid with any consecutive success .",852
cp06,"`` How's your luck , honey '' ?",853
cp06,A short platinum blonde in a bursting sun-suit addressed him .,854
cp06,"She looked well-fed and prosperous , but he didn't get the impression he was being propositioned the way he'd been hoping .",855
cp06,`` I haven't had any luck since I was a baby '' .,856
cp06,"`` Stake me '' , she said , `` and let me at those dice .",857
cp06,I'll make them dance the tango .,858
cp06,We'll get it in a hurry and get it out '' .,859
cp06,`` Let's have a drink and discuss a merger '' .,860
cp06,"`` If you go broke '' , she said , smiling up at him , `` I'll leave you '' .",861
cp06,"`` Sounds like real love '' , Owen said .",862
cp06,`` It sort of brings a lump to my throat '' .,863
cp06,"`` My name's Gisele '' , the blonde said after she ordered a Scotch .",864
cp06,`` Named after the ballet .,865
cp06,"My mother wanted to call me Sylphide , but it sounded too affected '' .",866
cp23,"Under normal circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs .",867
cp23,"Today , he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach .",868
cp23,"Breakfast , he thought .",869
cp23,A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better .,870
cp23,"He looked around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove .",871
cp23,Then he remembered .,872
cp23,"`` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable .",873
cp23,"In the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement .",874
cp23,"Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ?",875
cp23,She had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units .,876
cp23,And where was the thing ?,877
cp23,"He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables .",878
cp23,"Ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda '' between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four .",879
cp23,"It was still raining , and Mrs. Kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta .",880
cp23,"Charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day .",881
cp23,"This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it .",882
cp23,"`` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said .",883
cp23,"`` Lots of sun , lots of rest .",884
cp23,The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound .,885
cp23,This is a sleeping capsule .,886
cp23,The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked .,887
cp23,"You young men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly '' .",888
cp23,Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment .,889
cp23,"The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ; but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it .",890
cp23,"He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on .",891
cp23,"He had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women .",892
cp23,"Once burned -- scalded , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy .",893
cp23,"From now on , his was going to be a man's world : the North Woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries .",894
cp23,"Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery .",895
cp23,"In these damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia .",896
cp23,"He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him .",897
cp23,`` Three-day blow '' !,898
cp23,She bellowed triumphantly .,899
cp23,He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists .,900
cp23,"`` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added .",901
cp23,"`` I hope so '' , he said .",902
cp23,`` I've got this cold .,903
cp23,Thought I'd bake it out in the sun '' .,904
cp23,`` Ah '' .,905
cp23,She studied him briefly .,906
cp23,`` You've got a peaked look .,907
cp23,Better get in out of the wet '' .,908
cp23,"Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof .",909
cp23,"As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever .",910
cp23,"He could imagine her at this minute , honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss .",911
cp23,"All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long .",912
cp23,"He leafed through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins ( At the Seashore , At the Mountains , On the Farm , and In Danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle , hideously illustrated .",913
cp23,"He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin .",914
cp23,"He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy .",915
cp23,"His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four .",916
cp23,"He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind .",917
cp23,"Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator .",918
cp23,`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ?,919
cp23,Said this note .,920
cp23,`` The smell permeates everything '' !,921
cp23,"Everything being the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion .",922
cp23,"The note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine .",923
cp23,"Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol .",924
cp23,"He scrawled `` Sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat '' ?",925
cp23,"He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ; but on the other hand , he didn't want her swiping his salami .",926
cp23,"`` Not onions '' , came the answer the following day .",927
cp23,`` Ugh '' .,928
cp23,"Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen .",929
cp23,"But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense .",930
cp23,Take Vivian .,931
cp23,"Yes , take Vivian .",932
cp23,Somebody had .,933
cp23,"Now , if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink .",934
cp23,"They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself .",935
cp23,"Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy .",936
cp23,`` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ?,937
cp23,He mused aloud .,938
cp23,Eh '' ?,939
cp23,"It was Mrs. Kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails .",940
cp23,`` What's that you say '' ?,941
cp23,"`` Oh , nothing .",942
cp23,Just glad the rain's stopped '' .,943
cp23,"`` Oh , yes .",944
cp23,Just look at that sky .,945
cp23,Be a scorcher by afternoon '' .,946
cp23,`` I hope so .,947
cp23,I've got this cold '' .,948
cp23,`` So you said '' .,949
cp23,She scrutinized him .,950
cp23,"`` My , you're peaked .",951
cp23,"You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day .",952
cp23,I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur .,953
cp23,That pale kind's the worst '' .,954
cp23,"That pale kind , Charlie thought .",955
cp23,Hardly an inviting description .,956
cp23,"But then , neither was peaked .",957
cp23,"He could hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn .",958
cp23,"`` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say .",959
cp23,`` He's that peaked kind '' .,960
cp23,Surely there was a better word .,961
cp23,Charlie looked in the mirror .,962
cp23,"Run-down , iron-poor .",963
cp23,He looked more closely .,964
cp23,"Frail , feeble -- peaked .",965
cp23,"Clearly , two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good .",966
cp23,"The sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties .",967
cp23,"When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators .",968
cp23,"This weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with Cape roses , maybe , at the door .",969
cp23,"He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest .",970
cp23,"The sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes .",971
cp23,"No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes .",972
cp23,"He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping .",973
cp23,It gave him a good feeling .,974
cp23,`` M-m-m .,975
cp23,"Thanks '' , was her answer the next day .",976
cp23,"The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : `` You're not at all well , are you '' ?",977
cp23,"`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote .",978
cp23,Not that it was any of her business .,979
cp23,"`` It's none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be ninety-six .",980
cp23,"I mean , she's still living , and she's ninety-six .",981
cp23,Why don't you try that '' ?,982
cp23,`` I don't have a lemon '' .,983
cp23,He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper .,984
cp23,"By the next morning , she had turned the paper over .",985
cp23,"`` Gee , neither do I '' .",986
cp23,Charlie grinned .,987
cp23,She didn't sound like a pale girl .,988
cp23,She sounded a little like a redhead .,989
cp23,"But then , redheads are often pale .",990
cp23,He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office .,991
cp23,`` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice .,992
cp23,I haven't seen her on the beach '' .,993
cp23,"`` You won't , if you're looking for a redhead .",994
cp23,She's got browny hair '' .,995
cp23,"He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit .",996
cp23,"There were pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits .",997
cp23,There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits .,998
cp23,"Up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting .",999
cp23,"He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , turtle-neck sweaters .",1000
cp23,"On the beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls .",1001
cp23,And he saw them all as he walked up and down .,1002
cp23,"At two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down Peony , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , moonlit beach .",1003
cp23,"Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note .",1004
cp23,"`` I've got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion .",1005
cp23,Hope you don't mind '' .,1006
cp23,"`` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered .",1007
cp23,"`` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ?",1008
cp23,"Use all the lotion you want , and for goodness' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' .",1009
cp23,"This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided .",1010
cp23,Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman .,1011
cp23,"Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy .",1012
cp23,"She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own .",1013
cp23,"He didn't know what was so tough about Vivian's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name .",1014
cp23,Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ?,1015
cp23,Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion .,1016
cp23,"She might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over .",1017
cp23,"Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion .",1018
cp23,Correspondence passed back and forth .,1019
cp23,`` How's your sunburn now ?,1020
cp23,"The only thing , this lotion has glycerin in it , and that whitens the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it '' .",1021
cp23,"`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' .",1022
cp23,`` That Mrs. Kirby !,1023
cp23,"I'll bet she told you I was puny , too .",1024
cp23,How's your cold '' ?,1025
cp23,`` Broiled out .,1026
cp23,She didn't say you were puny .,1027
cp23,Are you ?,1028
cp23,What's puny '' ?,1029
cp23,`` Puny goes with pale and peaked .,1030
cp23,Do you have anything to read while you're shut up ?,1031
cp23,"There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe ' ; ; but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister .",1032
cp23,Also the canoe '' .,1033
cp04,"`` He must have forgiven me '' , Henrietta murmured to the room .",1034
cp04,The absolution of Doaty's last will and testament was proof enough of that ; ; Doaty would never have left her house to a godless woman .,1035
cp04,"She found herself wishing an old wish , that she had told Doaty she was running away , that she had left something more behind her than the loving , sorry note and her best garnet pin .",1036
cp04,Perhaps Doaty had guessed already and kept her counsel .,1037
cp04,"Henrietta thought , It's extraordinary how much she always knew about both of us .",1038
cp04,"There had been more to know about Hetty , inevitably , and most of it unfavorable .",1039
cp04,"Adelia was the good one , or , if not always good , less frequently tempted .",1040
cp04,"Their childhood would have been quite circumspect without Hetty's flair for drama , especially through the long summers .",1041
cp04,"In winter , in the city , there had been the Maneret School , which taught excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge ; ; there had been lessons in French from a small Polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for his pupils ; ; there had been the dancing class -- Miss Craddock , thin and tireless , with her supervising wand and her everlasting one-two-three , one-two-three .",1042
cp04,"There had been supper parties and teas , fetes and little balls , Mama small and pretty and gay and Papa enormously jocular , enormously possessive , the sun around which the Blackwell planets revolved .",1043
cp04,"Mama had died before the corruption of the family circle , the interruption of Charles .",1044
cp04,"It was safe to assume that Papa , sighing heavily , had said many times to his remaining daughter , `` Thank God your poor mother was spared this '' , and indeed it might be true that it had been easier for Henrietta to leave , with her hand in Charles' hand , just because her `` poor mother '' was gone already and would never know .",1045
cp04,Mama was vulnerable ; ; one had always felt the need to make a safe world around her .,1046
cp04,"But I would have gone anyway , thought Henrietta .",1047
cp04,She had always been able to ignore the moral question because there had been no choice .,1048
cp04,Only at this moment -- perhaps because it was before dawn and she was lying in Doaty's bed -- she found herself examining how others might regard her .,1049
cp04,Perhaps they would argue that morality consisted just of that ability to see a choice .,1050
cp04,"She turned on her side , finding the idea oppressive .",1051
cp04,"If Adelia had felt about someone as Henrietta felt about Charles , would she have run away with him ?",1052
cp04,Impossible to imagine Adelia feeling so about anyone .,1053
cp04,"No temptation , no sin .",1054
cp04,"No temptation , no virtue ?",1055
cp04,A curious thought to end a curious night .,1056
cp04,"The birds were really awake now in a colloquy of music , and light was beginning to creep across the room , touching sill and door , table and chair and all of Doaty's flowers in their artificial blossom and leaf .",1057
cp04,"Before anything else , she would go to Doaty's grave with flowers from Doaty's forgotten garden .",1058
cp04,"Everything must wait upon this mission , this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoided graveyards .",1059
cp04,"She closed her eyes , remembering the small French cemetery , enclosed by stone walls .",1060
cp04,"It had always seemed to rain there , and even the grass was gray .",1061
cp04,"After the sad impatient moment , waiting for comfort which could not come , she slipped out of bed and went to the open window .",1062
cp04,The garden below was lacy with dew and enchanting in its small wildness .,1063
cp04,"Leaning out , she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle , one not quite come to bloom , one just beyond it .",1064
cp04,"On a thrusting spray thick with thorns and dewdrops and swelling pink buds , like a summer Valentine , a bird balanced and sang , nondescriptly brown and alive with its own music , a little engine of song .",1065
cp04,"It was so pretty and artless that she felt like a child again and would have enjoyed running out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the growing things , but Doaty never permitted bare feet and she was decidedly not a child but une femme d'un certain age .",1066
cp04,"Feeling suddenly neat and subdued , she dressed quite soberly and went downstairs .",1067
cp04,"Rosa , unbelievably , was not yet up and about , reassurance that Rosa was human .",1068
cp04,"Feeling protective toward this sleeping being , Henrietta found a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug , a breakfast which was somewhat the equivalent of going barefoot .",1069
cp04,"Outside , the garden , the tame wilderness , yielded a patchwork bouquet of daisies , sweet william , scented stock and lady's bedstraw , which she tied with long grasses and took back to show Rosa , who was now stirring about the kitchen and haranguing Folly .",1070
cp04,"The poodle came gleefully to Henrietta and begged for the flowers , supplicating the air with prayerful forepaws .",1071
cp04,Henrietta held her bouquet out of reach and said it was for Doaty .,1072
cp04,"`` Rummaging in the dew '' , said Rosa coldly .",1073
cp04,`` Go change your shoes before you turn around '' .,1074
cp04,She sounded so exactly like Doaty that Henrietta obeyed her under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home .,1075
cp04,"Folly danced , eager for whatever lay beyond the door .",1076
cp04,"To a Blackwell , there was only one church .",1077
cp04,"The cemetery slumbered just behind it , and the way lay through the village and close to the sea .",1078
cp04,"For the first time in thirty years , Henrietta walked down the narrow street with its shuttered shops just stirring and its inhabitants eying her with the frankest curiosity .",1079
cp04,"She smiled and bowed , recalling the princess-in-a-carriage feeling she had enjoyed when she was a child .",1080
cp04,"Now , some of the acknowledgments were cautious , but all were interested .",1081
cp04,"An old man , sitting against the wall of a cottage and waiting for the sun to find him , gave her a more than reflective look as she passed , the sap still plainly rising in his branches .",1082
cp04,"On an impulse , she turned back and said good morning .",1083
cp04,"He cupped his ear and shook his head at her repetition , announcing in a nettled way that he had heard her the first time .",1084
cp04,"He then offered his own estimate of the weather , which was unenthusiastic .",1085
cp04,"`` Summer's been slow to come '' , he said .",1086
cp04,`` It's my dryin' out time '' .,1087
cp04,He scowled at her flowers .,1088
cp04,"`` I'm taking them to the cemetery '' , said Henrietta , out of a vague feeling of hospitality .",1089
cp04,"`` They'll be takin' me next '' , he said pleasantly , `` but not so soon's they plan .",1090
cp04,See half of 'em in their graves before I choose my own coffin .,1091
cp04,It's dryin' myself out that does it '' .,1092
cp04,He regarded her with rising hope .,1093
cp04,`` You'd like to hear how I go about it '' .,1094
cp04,"`` It's nice of you '' , Henrietta said doubtfully .",1095
cp04,`` Y're welcome '' .,1096
cp04,"He straightened himself , soldierly against the wall , and pulled his sprawled feet together so they stood side by side in their old boots .",1097
cp04,His stick ceased to be a thing to rest his chin on and became a pointer for emphasizing the finer aspects of his text .,1098
cp04,"`` Every month , f'r three days '' , he said happily , `` I take no water into my system , no water whatsoever .",1099
cp04,It rests the tissues '' .,1100
cp04,"Henrietta murmured that she could quite see how it would , and he nodded approval of her womanly good sense .",1101
cp04,"`` Rests the tissues '' , he said , `` and pacifies the system .",1102
cp04,"My dad did it , and he lived to a great age '' .",1103
cp04,He looked up at her sharply .,1104
cp04,"`` Don't remember , do you '' ?",1105
cp04,"She did suddenly , through the link of memory with his father , old Titus , who must have been in his nineties when Henrietta ran away .",1106
cp04,"Next to the Blackwells , Titus had owned the island most , and she and Adelia had often stood in front of him , silenced by his terrible years -- a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eyes like a mariner , more aged than possible .",1107
cp04,"He had never spoken once to the awed sisters , but his son had been friendly , a big fellow of fifty or more , a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea .",1108
cp04,"It must be that son who sat before her now , shriveled to half his size and half his senses .",1109
cp04,"She said gently , `` Of course I remember you '' .",1110
cp04,"`` Not so well's I remember you '' , he said .",1111
cp04,`` Y're the young Blackwell woman .,1112
cp04,Ran away on a black night with a lawful wedded man .,1113
cp04,I know all about you '' .,1114
cp04,"`` You do seem to '' , said Henrietta , impressed .",1115
cp04,"`` Can't blame a man for leavin' his wife '' , he said quite cheerfully .",1116
cp04,"`` Left mine many a time , only she never knew it .",1117
cp04,"Man in a boat , there's a lot of places he can put in at and a lot of reasons he can be away for a bit .",1118
cp04,Any harm in that '' ?,1119
cp04,"`` Probably '' , said Henrietta dryly .",1120
cp04,He gave a short hard laugh and looked at her knowingly .,1121
cp04,"`` You'd be the one to say '' , he observed , and she found herself liking his approval none too well , but she could not defend herself and say that her actions were `` different '' , since all actions had their own laws .",1122
cp04,"Only , this old man's connivance was even less to her taste than Selma Cotter's open censure .",1123
cp04,"Well , she had not come back to Great Island to be understood , praised or condemned .",1124
cp04,"She had come to make her peace with the past , and of that past this ancient of the earth was only a kind of shadow .",1125
cp04,"She started to move away , just as a woman came out of the cottage , a big-boned , drab-haired figure with a clean apron tied over her limp print dress .",1126
cp04,She smiled vaguely at Henrietta and spoke to the old man .,1127
cp04,"`` You've not had your breakfast yet , gran'dad '' .",1128
cp04,"`` Y'r dam' porridge is no breakfast '' , he said .",1129
cp04,`` Milk and sops '' !,1130
cp04,"He beat the air with his stick , and it fell from his claws and clattered on the stones .",1131
cp04,"`` He's lowly today '' , his grand-daughter said wearily , and bent to pick it up .",1132
cp04,`` He's got this idea about drying out '' `` It ain't an idea '' !,1133
cp04,"`` If it ain't an idea '' , she said , `` how comes it you can drink beer but not water '' ?",1134
cp04,"He looked piously to heaven and said , `` Beer don't affect the tissues none '' , and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense pleased Henrietta so that she forgave him his stint of malevolence .",1135
cp04,His grand-daughter sighed .,1136
cp04,"`` Come on , do .",1137
cp04,"The children are eating , and Miss Blackwell's on her way somewheres '' .",1138
cp04,`` To the graveyard .,1139
cp04,Who ain't '' ?,1140
cp04,`` Not me .,1141
cp04,I've got a day's work to do .,1142
cp04,"-- You'll be visiting Miss Doaty , Ma'am '' ?",1143
cp04,Henrietta nodded .,1144
cp04,How much they knew about her !,1145
cp04,"The woman ( she must have been a tiny baby when Hetty and Delia had stood arm in arm , watching great age grow small ) answered the nod with her own .",1146
cp04,"`` God rest her soul , she was a sweet one .",1147
cp04,Come on now '' .,1148
cp04,"She put a strong hand under the old man's arm and lifted him up , patiently , with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old .",1149
cp04,"He mumbled at her but let himself be led off inside the house , shuffling mightily to make it clear how weak and aged he was and how he was buffeted about by those who still had their wicked strength .",1150
cp04,"There was a gabble of voices from indoors , young hungry sounds like cats after fish , and a burst of swearing from the old man .",1151
cp04,"Henrietta looked down at her bouquet , still lively with its color and scent , and set her feet on their journey's way again , leaving the village street and crossing the first field , Folly dancing ahead of her .",1152
cp04,"At the edge of the field , the wild rolling land took over , dotted with fat round bushes like sheep .",1153
cp04,"They were covered with tiny white blossoms , their scant roots clawing at the stony ground , and wild birds darted in and about and through them so they were nearly alive with the rustle and cry .",1154
cp04,"The air was full of sounds too but placid ones , a terrestrial humming as much out of the earth as out of the blue sky .",1155
cp04,"She felt mindless , walking , and almost easy until the church spire told her she was near the cemetery , and she caught herself wondering what she would say to Doaty .",1156
cp04,Both church and graveyard were smaller than she remembered them ( how many things had lessened while she was gone away ) but the headstones had grown so thick in thirty years that to find one named `` Dorothy Tredding '' seemed suddenly impossible .,1157
cp04,"She sat down on the nearest , fallen with age and gray with sea-damp , her fingers tracing the indecipherable carved letters padded with green moss .",1158
cp04,"The day's sun was gathering its strength in gold , and she wished she had brought her parasol , if only to shade Doaty's flowers .",1159
cp04,"A small , rock-carved angel watched her from a nearby tomb , the only angel in the cemetery .",1160
cp04,"She remembered , suddenly , a night of savage moonlight and scudding clouds when she and Adelia , having dared each other , had stolen out of their great safe house and come here , hand in hand , hoping and fearing ghosts .",1161
cp16,"Unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand .",1162
cp16,Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving .,1163
cp16,"For eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before Esperanza Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards .",1164
cp16,The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced .,1165
cp16,"They walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` Eats '' sign jiggling in the wind .",1166
cp16,Now they were in friendly territory .,1167
cp16,Nobody around .,1168
cp16,Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge .,1169
cp16,"His rock was to the right of a V-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers .",1170
cp16,His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here .,1171
cp16,Here he was enclosed and safe .,1172
cp16,"( If a dragon or a sea monster came along , didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew ?",1173
cp16,Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe .,1174
cp16,He was Canute controlling the waves .,1175
cp16,"He was a knight of the Round Table , `` Sir Quintus the Brave '' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses .",1176
cp16,"( One good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show . )",1177
cp16,"He was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature .",1178
cp16,"He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to .",1179
cp16,Fearless .,1180
cp16,"Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ?",1181
cp16,"A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad .",1182
cp16,He hadn't intended to make the promise .,1183
cp16,"It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America .",1184
cp16,"Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint .",1185
cp16,It's all right .,1186
cp16,Stop shaking '' .,1187
cp16,"He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar .",1188
cp16,`` Let's talk about the beach .,1189
cp16,Son .,1190
cp16,"While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ?",1191
cp16,"Look , I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck .",1192
cp16,Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg .,1193
cp16,He says you're limping more than you need to '' .,1194
cp16,`` How does he know ?,1195
cp16,Big dumb nut .,1196
cp16,He never had polio '' .,1197
cp16,In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out .,1198
cp16,"`` You just wait , Dad .",1199
cp16,When you get back I'll probly be swimming better than Victoria .,1200
cp16,"Wait and see , Dad '' .",1201
cp16,"Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach .",1202
cp16,He called her `` Fatso '' .,1203
cp16,"She called him `` Stuck-up -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister Stuck-up '' .",1204
cp16,"Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' .",1205
cp16,`` She's got a nerve '' .,1206
cp16,Quint said now to the clouds .,1207
cp16,Strength began to zip up and down his chest .,1208
cp16,He felt strong as a giant .,1209
cp16,He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg .,1210
cp16,He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks .,1211
cp16,"`` Goolick , goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull .",1212
cp16,"`` Aw , shut up '' , he said .",1213
cp16,"He stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean .",1214
cp16,"The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves .",1215
cp16,I can't go in .,1216
cp16,I'm scared of the nightmare .,1217
cp16,"Shivering , he put on his clothes .",1218
cp16,"And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water .",1219
cp16,"`` Watch it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back .",1220
cp16,She was holding on to his rock with one hand .,1221
cp16,She smelled of peppermints .,1222
cp16,"She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no straps on the shouders .",1223
cp16,`` Why didn't you duck '' ?,1224
cp16,He snapped .,1225
cp16,`` This is my rock '' .,1226
cp16,`` Isn't '' .,1227
cp16,`` Is '' .,1228
cp16,`` Isn't '' .,1229
cp16,`` Is '' .,1230
cp16,She was sore as a boil .,1231
cp16,`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ?,1232
cp16,`` Sure .,1233
cp16,"They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' -- `` Mister Big Britches , aren't you '' ?",1234
cp16,`` I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth .,1235
cp16,They call me Quint '' .,1236
cp16,`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ?,1237
cp16,`` I said Quint .,1238
cp16,That's short for Quintus .,1239
cp16,"Quintus in Latin means '' -- `` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart aleck '' .",1240
cp16,Her cough sounded like cloth ripping .,1241
cp16,"`` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice .",1242
cp16,`` I don't smoke '' .,1243
cp16,She was horrified .,1244
cp16,`` Do you '' ?,1245
cp16,"`` Hell , yes '' .",1246
cp16,"Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum .",1247
cp16,"`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' .",1248
cp16,"`` If I was your mama , I'd wop your tail off '' .",1249
cp16,`` My mother never wops me .,1250
cp16,I've got this leg brace '' .,1251
cp16,She seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace .,1252
cp16,"`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said .",1253
cp16,`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ?,1254
cp16,`` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always .,1255
cp16,"Dr. Fortman says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' .",1256
cp16,She spouted a mouthful of water into the air .,1257
cp16,`` A cane's mighty handy .,1258
cp16,"Someone's walking past , you want to stop him , zoooop , snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane .",1259
cp16,"Or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is bannnnnng , stooooomp your cane on the floor .",1260
cp16,"Hey , will you look at that '' ?",1261
cp16,Maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail .,1262
cp16,`` That's some dog .,1263
cp16,What kind '' ?,1264
cp16,"`` Part collie , part wire-haired terrier '' .",1265
cp16,Quint glared .,1266
cp16,He always did when people asked .,1267
cp16,"`` Holy mackerel , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly .",1268
cp16,"`` His real name's DiMaggio , only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers .",1269
cp16,He's braver than he looks .,1270
cp16,He's been sick lately .,1271
cp16,Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag '' .,1272
cp16,`` A what '' ?,1273
cp16,"He would have told her , but Victoria was yodeling .",1274
cp16,That meant `` Mama wants you Quint .,1275
cp16,Come home or I'll come find you '' .,1276
cp16,`` I gotta go .,1277
cp16,"Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes .",1278
cp16,I come early in the morning '' .,1279
cp16,`` So do I .,1280
cp16,"See you around , Mister Squint '' .",1281
cp16,That was how they started being friends .,1282
cp16,They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter .,1283
cp16,"Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ; it made her blister .",1284
cp16,"Her name was Sabella , and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying love .",1285
cp16,`` You going to marry the King '' ?,1286
cp16,`` No .,1287
cp16,He's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork .,1288
cp16,My hair is what he's nuts about .,1289
cp16,Naturally curly hair runs in my family .,1290
cp16,"Personally , I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the Continent , ' What can one do ' '' ?",1291
cp16,`` Which continent '' ?,1292
cp16,"`` Name one , I been there '' .",1293
cp16,"Japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup .",1294
cp16,Pugh .,1295
cp16,Camels in Tripoli had harelips .,1296
cp16,Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night .,1297
cp16,"As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ; they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them .",1298
cp16,`` Really '' .,1299
cp16,Quint smothered a yawn .,1300
cp16,"She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so .",1301
cp16,"Artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War ; ; that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia .",1302
cp16,`` Books are for schnooks '' .,1303
cp16,"She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear .",1304
cp16,Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella .,1305
cp16,( `` What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ?,1306
cp16,Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' .,1307
cp16,And `` What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist ?,1308
cp16,Tooth-hurty '' . ),1309
cp16,Encouraged by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham .,1310
cp16,"He described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch .",1311
cp16,"He snuck up on the ham like Maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it .",1312
cp16,That dog has to go '' .,1313
cp16,"`` Say , you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said admiringly .",1314
cp16,`` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ?,1315
cp16,He hadn't .,1316
cp16,But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head .,1317
cp16,`` Either that or a veterinarian '' .,1318
cp16,"`` Better make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said .",1319
cp16,`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' .,1320
cp16,Sometimes they argued .,1321
cp16,She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward .,1322
cp16,His encylopedia agreed with Sabella .,1323
cp16,Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around .,1324
cp16,"Boy , could she catch !",1325
cp16,Like Willie Mays in the outfield .,1326
cp16,`` Nobody gave me flowers before .,1327
cp16,"Thank you , Quint '' .",1328
cp16,Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough .,1329
cp16,`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok '' .,1330
cp16,Sometimes they didn't talk at all .,1331
cp16,He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around .,1332
cp16,"Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared .",1333
cp16,"But Victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints .",1334
cp16,"As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time .",1335
cp16,Wednesday morning it happened .,1336
cp16,They were eating breakfast .,1337
cp16,"`` We beseech thee , Lord Gord , to bless this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib .",1338
cp16,"Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement .",1339
cp16,"`` Your Daddy's in San Francisco '' , she told them .",1340
cp16,`` He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane .,1341
cp16,Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ?,1342
cp16,"`` Yeah , keen '' .",1343
cp16,A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach .,1344
cp16,"`` Children , we'll have to get organized .",1345
cp16,The baby can have an early nap .,1346
cp16,"Victoria , I want you to -- '' Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared .",1347
cp16,"`` Hurry up , we're late '' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and Kool-Aid green .",1348
cp16,The cave in his stomach hurt .,1349
cp16,He had to go into the water .,1350
cp16,He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare .,1351
cp16,It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung .,1352
cp16,"What caused it , he didn't know .",1353
cp16,The metal collar gagging his neck ?,1354
cp16,Sweating so much ?,1355
cp16,The unbearable weight on his chest ?,1356
cp16,All of it together meant drowning .,1357
cp16,"The first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second .",1358
cc14,Elisabeth Schwarzkopf sang so magnificently Saturday night at Hunter College that it seems a pity to have to register any complaints .,1359
cc14,Still a demurrer or two must be entered .,1360
cc14,"Schwarzkopf is , of course , Schwarzkopf .",1361
cc14,"For style and assurance , for a supreme and regal bearing there is still no one who can touch her .",1362
cc14,"If the voice is just a shade less glorious than it used to be , it is still a beautiful instrument , controlled and flexible .",1363
cc14,"Put to the service of lieder of Schubert , Brahms , Strauss and Wolf in a dramatical and musical way , it made its effect with ease and precision .",1364
cc14,But what has been happening recently might be described as creeping mannerism .,1365
cc14,"Instead of her old confidence in the simplest , purest , most moving musical expression , Miss Schwarzkopf is letting herself be tempted by the classic sin of artistic pride -- that subtle vanity that sometimes misleads a great artist into thinking that he or she can somehow better the music by bringing to it something extra , some personal dramatic touch imposed from the outside .",1366
cc14,The symptoms Saturday night were unmistakable .,1367
cc14,"Clever light songs were overly coy , tragic songs a little too melodramatic .",1368
cc14,"There was an extra pause here , a gasp or a sigh there , here and there an extra little twist of a word or note , all in the interest of effect .",1369
cc14,The result was like that of a beautiful painting with some of the highlights touched up almost to the point of garishness .,1370
cc14,"There were stunning musical phrases too , and sometimes the deepest kind of musical and poetic absorption and communication .",1371
cc14,"Miss Schwarzkopf and her excellent pianist , John Wustman , often achieved the highest lyrical ideals of the lieder tradition .",1372
cc14,All the more reason why there should have been no place for the frills ; ; Miss Schwarzkopf is too great an artist to need them .,1373
cc14,"The dance , dancers and dance enthusiasts ( 8,500 of them ) had a much better time of it at Lewisohn Stadium on Saturday night than all had had two nights earlier , when Stadium Concerts presented the first of two dance programs .",1374
cc14,"On Saturday , the orchestra was sensibly situated down on the field , the stage floor was apparently in decent condition for dancing , and the order of the program improved .",1375
cc14,"There was , additionally , a bonus for the Saturday-night patrons .",1376
cc14,"Alvin Ailey and Carmen De Lavallade appeared in the first New York performance of Mr. Ailey's `` Roots Of The Blues '' , a work given its premiere three weeks ago at the Boston Arts Festival .",1377
cc14,"Otherwise , the program included , as on Thursday , the Taras-Tchaikovsky `` Design For Strings '' , the Dollar-Britten `` Divertimento '' , the Dollar-De Banfield `` The Duel '' and the pas de deux from `` The Nutcracker '' .",1378
cc14,"Maria Tallchief and Erik Bruhn , who danced the `` Nutcracker '' pas de deux , were also seen in the Petipa-Minkus pas de deux from `` Don Quixote '' , another brilliant showpiece that displayed their technical prowess handsomely .",1379
cc14,"Among the other solo ballet dancers of the evening , Elisabeth Carroll and Ivan Allen were particularly impressive in their roles in `` The Duel '' , a work that depends so much upon the precision and incisiveness of the two principal combatants .",1380
cc14,"Mr. Ailey's `` Roots Of The Blues '' , an earthy and very human modern dance work , provided strong contrast to the ballet selections of the evening .",1381
cc14,"As Brother John Sellers sang five `` blues '' to the guitar and drum accompaniments of Bruce Langhorne and Shep Shepard , Mr. Ailey and Miss De Lavallade went through volatile dances that were by turns insinuating , threatening , contemptuous and ecstatic .",1382
cc14,"Their props were two stepladders , a chair and a palm fan .",1383
cc14,"He wore the clothes of a laborer , and she was wondrously seductive in a yellow and orange dress .",1384
cc14,"The cat-like sinuousness and agility of both dancers were exploited in leaps , lifts , crawls and slides that were almost invariably compelling in a work of strong , sometimes almost frightening , tensions .",1385
cc14,"`` Roots Of The Blues '' may not be for gentle souls , but others should welcome its super-charged impact .",1386
cc14,`` Perhaps it is better to stay at home .,1387
cc14,The armchair traveler preserves his illusions '' .,1388
cc14,"This somewhat cynical comment may be found in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' , a collection of travel essays by William Sansom , who would never consider staying home for long .",1389
cc14,"Mr. Sansom is English , bearded , formidably cultivated , the versatile author of numerous volumes of short stories , of novels and of pieces that are neither short stories nor travel articles but something midway between .",1390
cc14,"The only man alive who seems qualified by his learning , his disposition and his addiction to a baroque luxuriance of language to inherit the literary mantle of Sacheverell Sitwell , Mr. Sansom writes of foreign parts with a dedication to decoration worthy of a pastry chef creating a wedding cake for the marriage of a Hungarian beauty ( her third ) and an American multimillionaire ( his fourth ) .",1391
cc14,"The result is rather wonderful , but so rich as to be indigestible if taken in too thick slices .",1392
cc14,"There are sixteen essays in `` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' .",1393
cc14,Most of them were written between 1953 and 1960 and originally appeared in various magazines .,1394
cc14,All are well written and are overwritten .,1395
cc14,"But , even if Mr. Sansom labors too hard to extract more refinements of meaning and feeling from his travel experiences than the limits of language allow , he still can charm and astound .",1396
cc14,Too many books and articles are just assembled by putting one word after another .,1397
cc14,"Mr. Sansom actually writes his with a nice ear for a gracefully composed sentence , with an intense relish in all the metaphorical resources of English , with a thick shower of sophisticated , cultural references .",1398
cc14,"A contemplative connoisseur `` I like to sniff a place , and reproduce what it really smells and looks like , its color , its particular kind of life '' .",1399
cc14,This is an exact description of what Mr. Sansom does .,1400
cc14,He ignores guidebook facts .,1401
cc14,He only rarely tells a personal anecdote and hardly ever sketches an individual or quotes his opinions .,1402
cc14,"It is an over-all impression Mr. Sansom strives for , an impression compounded of visual details , of a savory mixture of smells , of much loving attention to architecture and scenery , of lights and shadows , of intangibles of atmosphere and of echoes of the past .",1403
cc14,"William Sansom writes only about Europe in this book and frequently of such familiar places as London , Vienna , the French Riviera and the Norwegian fjords .",1404
cc14,But no matter what he writes about he brings to his subject his own original mind and his own sensitive reactions .,1405
cc14,"`` A writer lives , at best , in a state of astonishment '' , he says .",1406
cc14,`` Beneath any feeling he has of the good or the evil of the world lies a deeper one of wonder at it all .,1407
cc14,To transmit that feeling he writes '' .,1408
cc14,"This may not be true of many writers , but it certainly is true of Mr. Sansom .",1409
cc14,"So in these pages one can share his wonder at the traditional fiesta of St. Torpetius that still persists in St. Tropez ; ; at the sun and the heat of Mediterranean lands , always much brighter and hotter to an Englishman than to an American used to summers in New York or Kansas City ; ; at the supreme delights to be found in one of the world's finest restaurants , La Bonne Auberge , which is situated on the seacoast twenty miles west of the Nice airport ; ; and at the infinite variety of London .",1410
cc14,Mr. Sansom can be eloquent in a spectacular way which recalls ( to those who recall easily ) the statues of Bernini and the gigantic paintings of Tintoretto .,1411
cc14,He can coin a neat phrase : `` a street spattered with an invigoration of people '' ; ; tulips with `` petals wide and shaggy as a spaniel's ears '' ; ; after a snowstorm a landscape smelling `` of woodsmoke and clarity '' .,1412
cc14,"And , for all his lacquered , almost Byzantine self-consciousness , he can make one recognize the aptness of an unexpected comparison .",1413
cc14,Beauty borrowed from afar In one of his best essays Mr. Sansom expresses his enthusiasm for the many country mansions designed by Andrea Palladio himself that dot the environs of Vicenza .,1414
cc14,"How far that pedimented and pillared style has shed its influence Mr. Sansom reminds us thus : `` The white colonnaded , cedar-roofed Southern mansion is directly traceable via the grey and buff stone of grey-skied England to the golden stucco of one particular part of the blue South , the Palladian orbit stretching out from Vicenza : the old mind of Andrea Palladio still smiles from behind many an old rocking chair on a Southern porch , the deep friezes of his architectonic music rise firm above the shallower freeze in the kitchen , his feeling for light and shade brings a glitter from a tall mint julep , his sense of columns framing the warm velvet night has brought together a million couple of mating lips '' .",1415
cc14,"Nice , even if a trifle gaudy .",1416
cc14,"`` Blue Skies , Brown Studies '' is illustrated with numerous excellent photographs .",1417
cc14,"In recent days there have been extensive lamentations over the absence of original drama on television , but not for years have many regretted the passing of new plays on radio .",1418
cc14,"WBAI , the listener-supported outlet on the frequency-modulation band , has decided to do what it can to correct this aural void .",1419
cc14,"Yesterday it offered `` Poised For Violence '' , by Jean Reavey .",1420
cc14,"WBAI is on the right track : in the sound medium there has been excessive emphasis on music and news and there could and should be a place for theatre , as the Canadian and British Broadcasting Corporations continue to demonstrate .",1421
cc14,"Unfortunately , `` Poised For Violence '' was not the happiest vehicle with which to make the point .",1422
cc14,"Mrs. Reavey's work is written for the stage -- it is mentioned for an off-Broadway production in the fall -- and , in addition , employs an avant-garde structure that particularly needs to be seen if comprehension is to be encouraged .",1423
cc14,The play's device is to explore society's obsession with disaster and violence through the eyes of a group of artist's models who remain part of someone else's painting rather than just be themselves .,1424
cc14,"In a succession of scenes they appear in different guises -- patrons of a cafe , performers in a circus and participants in a family picnic -- but in each instance they inevitably put ugliness before beauty .",1425
cc14,Somewhere in Mrs. Reavey's play there is both protest and aspiration of merit .,1426
cc14,But its relentless discursiveness and determined complexity are so overwhelming that after an hour and a half a listener's stamina begins to wilt .,1427
cc14,"Moreover , her central figures are so busily fulfilling their multitudinous assignments that none emerges as an arresting individual in his own right or as a provocative symbol of mankind's ills .",1428
cc14,But quite conceivably an altogether different impression will obtain when the work is offered in the theatre and there can be other effects to relieve the burden on the author's words .,1429
cc14,Which in itself is an immediate reward of the WBAI experiment ; ; good radio drama has its own special demands that badly need reinvigoration .,1430
cc14,"A weekly showcase for contemporary music , from the austere archaism of Stravinsky to the bleeps and bloops of electronic music , is celebrating its fourth anniversary this month .",1431
cc14,Titled `` What's New In Music '' ?,1432
cc14,The enterprising program is heard Saturday afternoons on radio station Aj .,1433
cc14,"The brief notes introducing each work offer salient historical or technical points , and many listeners are probably grateful for being intelligently taken by the hand through an often difficult maze .",1434
cc14,"The show is programed and written by the station's assistant continuity editor , Chuck Briefer .",1435
cc14,The first Saturday in each month is set aside for new recordings .,1436
cc14,"Last Saturday's interesting melange included Ernst Toch , Karlheinz Stockhausen , Richard Yardumian and a brief excerpt from a new `` space '' opera by the Swedish composer , Karl-Birger Blomdahl .",1437
cc14,"Other Saturdays are devoted to studies of a selected American composer , a particular type of music or the music of a given country .",1438
cc14,It is commendable that a regularly scheduled hour is set aside for an introduction to the contemporary musical scene .,1439
cc14,"But one wishes , when the appetite is whetted , as it was in the case of the all-too-brief excerpt from the Blomdahl opera , that further opportunity would be provided both for hearing the works in their entirety and for a closer analytical look at the sense and nature of the compositions .",1440
cc14,The Moiseyev Dance Company dropped in at Madison Square Garden last night for the first of four farewell performances before it brings its long American tour to a close .,1441
cc14,"It is not simply giving a repetition of the program it gave during its New York engagement earlier this season , but has brought back many of the numbers that were on the bill when it paid us its first visit and won everybody's heart .",1442
cc14,It is good to see those numbers again .,1443
cc14,"The `` Suite Of Old Russian Dances '' that opened that inaugural program with the slow and modest entrance of the maidens and built steadily into typical Moiseyev vigor and warmth ; ; the amusing `` Yurochka '' , in which a hard-to-please young man is given his come-uppance ; ; the lovely ( and of course vigorous ) `` Polyanka '' or `` The Meadow '' ; ; the three Moldavian dances entitled `` Zhok '' ; ; the sweet and funny little dance about potato planting called `` Bul'ba '' ; ; and the hilarious picture of social life in an earlier day called `` City Quadrille '' are all just as good as one remembers them to have been , and they are welcome back .",1444
cc14,"So , for that matter , are the newer dances -- the `` Kalmuk Dance '' with its animal movements , that genial juggling act by Sergei Tsvetkov called `` The Platter '' , the rousing and beautiful betrothal celebration called `` Summer '' , `` The Three Shepherds '' of Azerbaijan hopping up on their staffs , and , of course , the trenchant `` Rock 'n' Roll '' .",1445
cp15,`` They make us conformists look good '' .,1446
cp15,`` That's a peculiar way to think '' .,1447
cp15,"It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ; she knew that .",1448
cp15,"It was Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra .",1449
cp15,"She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself .",1450
cp15,"`` Come , come '' , Jim said , jollying Lucy a little .",1451
cp15,`` I love you .,1452
cp15,Susan ready '' ?,1453
cp15,Lucy listened .,1454
cp15,"Obviously , Susan was not .",1455
cp15,"Upstairs , busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room .",1456
cp15,"Susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a prudent soul ; ; she always packed for a lifetime , just in case .",1457
cp15,`` Not yet .,1458
cp15,Every doll in the house must be going with her '' .,1459
cp15,`` She'd better step on it .,1460
cp15,It's a long way to Websterville '' .,1461
cp15,"Jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ; as he looked at her , it registered anxiety .",1462
cp15,"`` You know '' , he said .",1463
cp15,`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy .,1464
cp15,"It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' .",1465
cp15,Lucy did not believe him ; ; Myra appreciated nothing .,1466
cp15,Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth .,1467
cp15,"`` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend .",1468
cp15,`` She should have told me herself .,1469
cp15,And will it be only a couple of weeks ?,1470
cp15,Remember what happened the last time '' ?,1471
cp15,"Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them .",1472
cp15,"Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra's husband , hadn't gone out to fetch her .",1473
cp15,`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' .,1474
cp15,"For an otherwise silent moment , Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket .",1475
cp15,"`` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last .",1476
cp15,`` You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time .,1477
cp15,"You'll see , Myra's settling down '' .",1478
cp15,"On the defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' .",1479
cp15,`` It depends on the widow '' .,1480
cp15,Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it .,1481
cp15,And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down .,1482
cp15,"It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life .",1483
cp15,"Remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered Cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon .",1484
cp15,It was not that she disliked Cathy .,1485
cp15,"The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ; whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra .",1486
cp15,"But Cathy was Myra's responsibility , not hers .",1487
cp15,"`` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' .",1488
cp15,"Myra loved big cities ; ; thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother .",1489
cp15,Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible .,1490
cp15,`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' !,1491
cp15,"Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy .",1492
cp15,"He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` Susan !",1493
cp15,Susan !,1494
cp15,Get moving '' !,1495
cp15,A startled piping sound returned .,1496
cp15,"`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said .",1497
cp15,Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river ?,1498
cp15,"Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them .",1499
cp15,"Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ; Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line .",1500
cp15,Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her .,1501
cp15,"His dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed .",1502
cp15,"`` Please '' , he said .",1503
cp15,`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen .,1504
cp15,Let's stay friends '' .,1505
cp15,"But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ; they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage .",1506
cp15,"The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his .",1507
cp15,Lucy was sick of it .,1508
cp15,"`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs .",1509
cp15,Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ; her arms were straining with a burden of dolls .,1510
cp15,"`` I'm ready '' , she announced .",1511
cp15,`` Do you need that big bundle '' ?,1512
cp15,Jim said .,1513
cp15,"His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment .",1514
cp15,`` All that junk '' ?,1515
cp15,"Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ; to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart .",1516
cp15,"`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully .",1517
cp15,"`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' .",1518
cp15,"She gave Jim a quick , shape-up look of warning .",1519
cp15,`` She'll take every one of them '' .,1520
cp15,"Jim groaned , but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand .",1521
cp15,"And when you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you .",1522
cp15,Nice '' ?,1523
cp15,"`` No '' , Susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect .",1524
cp15,"And at this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with Susan ; ; there ought to be a limit to sharing , too .",1525
cp15,"That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit , short or long ; ; the last one had been a Lilliputian war .",1526
cp15,She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had .,1527
cp15,"`` Well '' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' .",1528
cp15,"When the car , with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust .",1529
cp15,"The day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it .",1530
cp15,"She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss .",1531
cp15,"She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that .",1532
cp15,She turned and began to walk toward the house .,1533
cp15,"At the feeding station , the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered vestments .",1534
cp15,"The handsome bird was solitary ; ; its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest .",1535
cp15,"She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ; the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels .",1536
cp15,"Well , Lucy ?",1537
cp15,"She said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds .",1538
cp15,"She had a day of things to do ; ; among them , she had to prepare the guest room .",1539
cp15,How long would it be occupied ?,1540
cp15,"She wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness .",1541
cp15,As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ?,1542
cp15,"For a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself .",1543
cp15,It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests .,1544
cp15,"In the sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room .",1545
cp15,"There were new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze .",1546
cp15,"A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed .",1547
cp15,"The closet was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes .",1548
cp15,Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her .,1549
cp15,"Out in the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished .",1550
cp15,"When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there .",1551
cp15,"`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said .",1552
cp15,`` I just thought I'd let you know .,1553
cp15,"Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago .",1554
cp15,I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' .,1555
cp15,`` I can imagine '' !,1556
cp15,"Susan was an active character ; ; for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls .",1557
cp15,"Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ; she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her .",1558
cp15,"You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic .",1559
cp15,`` How was Cathy '' ?,1560
cp15,`` Subdued .,1561
cp15,But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw '' .,1562
cp15,"On her way to the airport , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself .",1563
cp15,`` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' .,1564
cp15,"There was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ?",1565
cp15,"`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' .",1566
cp15,"`` Well '' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life .",1567
cp15,"Puzzled , Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ; her mother was forthright ; ; she was not usually given to mysterious silences .",1568
cp15,Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good ?,1569
cp15,`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ?,1570
cp15,"Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ?",1571
cp15,"Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ?",1572
cp15,"Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do .",1573
cp15,"Just before Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near '' .",1574
cp15,"She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them .",1575
cp15,"`` Cathy was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' '' .",1576
cp15,"Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there .",1577
cp15,"Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake .",1578
cp15,`` Christmastime !,1579
cp15,Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ; it was only too true .,1580
cp15,Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks .,1581
cp15,"For a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it .",1582
cp15,`` That does it '' !,1583
cp15,She said .,1584
cp15,`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks .,1585
cp15,"Then , if Myra does nothing about fetching her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself '' !",1586
cp15,Her hand tightened on the receiver .,1587
cp15,`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' .,1588
cp15,"For Lucy , the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end .",1589
cp15,"As she hung up , she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings , and heard their grotesque singing .",1590
cp15,Cowbird Myra !,1591
cp15,She's not going to get away with it .,1592
cp15,"Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path .",1593
cp15,The child's thin legs were plodding .,1594
cp15,"She trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear .",1595
cp15,"She was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house .",1596
cp15,"Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ; the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had .",1597
cp15,"Lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ; they would have to buy things for her .",1598
cp15,She opened the door .,1599
cl08,`` Well '' -- said Mr. Skyros .,1600
cl08,`` I take a little time to think it over '' .,1601
cl08,It was awkward : very awkward .,1602
cl08,There would be all the nuisance of contacting someone else to take over .,1603
cl08,Someone reasonably trustworthy .,1604
cl08,And Angie would hear about it .,1605
cl08,"And Angie knew -- `` Time '' , said Angie , and he smiled very sweet and slow at Mr. Skyros .",1606
cl08,"`` Not too much time , because I'll be needing some more myself pretty much right away .",1607
cl08,"And I done favors for you , big favor not so long back , didn't I , and I'm right here to take on where Pretty left off .",1608
cl08,No trouble .,1609
cl08,"I don't want no trouble , you don't want no trouble , nobody wants trouble , Mr. Skyros '' .",1610
cl08,"Dear heaven , no , thought Mr. Skyros , turning away as another man came in .",1611
cl08,He straightened his tie at the mirror with a shaking hand ; ; the genial smile seemed painted on his face .,1612
cl08,Angie knew -- Speak of dangerous information !,1613
cl08,Angie knew too much entirely already .,1614
cl08,Really he had Mr. Skyros at bay `` Big favor I done you .,1615
cl08,"Acourse there's this deal o' Denny's -- and Jackie's -- kinda hangin' fire , ain't it , maybe you've been kinda worryin' over that .",1616
cl08,"And can't say I blame you '' , said Angie thoughtfully .",1617
cl08,`` This deal with the ace o' spades .,1618
cl08,"Anything to do with an ace o' spades , bad luck '' .",1619
cl08,"Ace of spades -- a widow , that was what they called a widow , these low-class crooks remembered Mr. Skyros distractedly .",1620
cl08,"All about that Angie knew , too .",1621
cl08,"When things got a little out of hand , they very rapidly got a lot out of hand -- it seemed to be a general rule .",1622
cl08,"All just by chance , and in a way tracing back to poor Frank , all of it , because naturally -- brothers , living together -- and Angie -- Mr. Skyros did not at all like the look on Angelo's regular-featured , almost girlishly good-looking face -- or indeed anything about Angelo .",1623
cl08,"Mr. Skyros was not a man who thought very much about moral principles ; ; he found money much more interesting ; ; but all the same he thought now , uneasily , of the way in which Angelo earned his living -- and paid for his own stuff -- and eyed the soft smile , and the spaniel-like dark eyes , and he felt a little ill .",1624
cl08,"`` Look , my friend '' , he said , `` in my life I learn , how is it the proverb says , better an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure .",1625
cl08,I stay in business so long because I'm careful .,1626
cl08,"Two weeks , a month , we talk it over again , and maybe if nothing happens meanwhile to say the cops know this and that , then we make a little deal , isn't it '' ?",1627
cl08,"`` That's a long while '' , said Angie .",1628
cl08,"`` I tell you , you want to leave it that way , I don't fool around with it .",1629
cl08,I go over to Castro and get fixed up there .,1630
cl08,I can't wait no two weeks '' .,1631
cl08,"And Mr. Skyros didn't like Angie , but what with Prettyman and three of his boys inside , and not likely to come out -- And Angie such a valuable salesman , Prettyman said -- All the nuisance and danger of getting in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boys -- Why did everything have to happen at once ?",1632
cl08,"Denny said stupidly , `` Why , you ain't turning Angie down , are you , Mr. Skyros ?",1633
cl08,"I mean , we all figured -- I guess anybody'd figure -- Angie '' -- Angelo gave him an affectionate smile .",1634
cl08,"`` Mr. Skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of me '' , he said .",1635
cl08,`` It's O.K.,1636
cl08,", Denny , everything's O.K.",1637
cl08,"Ain't it , Mr. Skyros '' ?",1638
cl08,"Oh , God , the name repeated over and over , anybody to hear -- Not being a fool , Mr. Skyros knew why .",1639
cl08,"But aside from everything else , it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealings with one who was nominally an underling and actually held -- you could say -- the whip hand .",1640
cl08,And all because of Domokous !,1641
cl08,"If Mr. Skyros had dreamed of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause -- Of course , there was another factor .",1642
cl08,"Angie worth his weight in gold right now , but these users , they sometimes went down fast .",1643
cl08,"Who knew , Angie might not last long .",1644
cl08,"The sweat broke out on Mr. Skyros' forehead as he realized he had been actually thinking -- hoping -- planning -- perhaps -- Good God above , had not Domokous been enough ?",1645
cl08,He patted Angelo's thin shoulder paternally .,1646
cl08,"`` Now you don't want to go talking that way '' , he said .",1647
cl08,"`` Sure , sure , you're the one take over for Pretty , soon as I get the supply , get started up again , isn't it ?",1648
cl08,"You don't need worry , Angelo .",1649
cl08,"I tell you , I know how it is with you , my friend , I sympathize , and I'll make it a special point -- a special favor -- get in touch , and get some stuff just for you .",1650
cl08,"I don't know if I can manage it tonight or tomorrow , but I'll try my best , my friend .",1651
cl08,"You see , you got to remember , we all got schedules , like any business !",1652
cl08,"My man , he won't be around a little while , he just fixed me up with this stuff they took out of the Elite .",1653
cl08,"It's awkward , you see that , isn't it '' ?",1654
cl08,"`` Well , that's your business , Mr. Skyros '' , said Angie , and his dreamy eyes moved past Mr. Skyros' shoulder to gaze vaguely out the ground-glass window .",1655
cl08,"`` I appreciate it , you do that .",1656
cl08,Sure .,1657
cl08,We don't none of us want no trouble .,1658
cl08,"I'm in a room over the Golden Club on San Pedro , you just ask for me there , you want see me .",1659
cl08,Or maybe I call you -- tonight ?,1660
cl08,"About nine o'clock , I call and see if you got any .",1661
cl08,"A couple decks for me , Mr. Skyros -- and ten-twelve to sell , see , I like to have a little ready cash '' .",1662
cl08,"`` Oh , now , I don't know about that much '' , said Mr. Skyros .",1663
cl08,"`` And you know , Angelo , Pretty , he always keeps it a strict cash basis , like they say '' -- `` Sure '' , said Angie .",1664
cl08,"`` Sure , Mr. Skyros .",1665
cl08,"Fifty a throw , that the deal ?",1666
cl08,Sure .,1667
cl08,"I bring you the cash , say five hundred for ten decks .",1668
cl08,"Never mind how much I cut it , how much I get '' , and he smiled his sleepy smile again .",1669
cl08,"`` Standard deal , Mr. Skyros .",1670
cl08,You go 'n' have a look round for it '' .,1671
cl08,"`` I do my best '' , said Mr. Skyros earnestly , `` just for you , my friend .",1672
cl08,"This is awkward for everybody , isn't it , we all got to put up with inconvenience sometimes .",1673
cl08,But I do my best for you '' .,1674
cl08,"He got out of there in a hurry , brushing past another man in the door , mopping his brow .",1675
cl08,"The expedient thing -- yes , very true , one must make do as one could , in some situations .",1676
cl08,It could all be straightened out later .,1677
cl08,"Not very much later , but when things had settled down a little .",1678
cl08,After this deal with the Bouvardier woman went through .,1679
cl08,An ace of spades .,1680
cl08,"He was not a superstitious man , but he felt perhaps there was a little something in that , indeed .",1681
cl08,"He rather wished he had never got into the business , and still -- scarcely to be resisted , a nice little profit with not much work involved , easy money Katya Roslev , who would be Katharine Ross so very soon now , rang up her first sale of the day and counted back the change .",1682
cl08,She did not notice that the customer seized her purchase and turned away without a smile or a word of thanks .,1683
cl08,"Usually she marked the few who did thank you , you didn't get that kind much in a place like this : and she played a little game with herself , seeing how downright rude she could act to the others , before they'd take offense , threaten to call the manager .",1684
cl08,"Funny how seldom they did : used to it , probably .",1685
cl08,The kind who came into a cheap store like this !,1686
cl08,"Grab , snatch , I saw that first !",1687
cl08,"And , Here , I'll take this , I was before her , you wait on me now or I don't bother with it , see !",1688
cl08,"This kind of place She'd be through here , just no time at all -- leave this kind of thing 'way behind .",1689
cl08,"Off at noon , and she'd never come back .",1690
cl08,Never have to .,1691
cl08,"Money -- a lot of money , enough .",1692
cl08,"She'd be smart about it , get him to give it to her in little bills so's nobody would suspect -- maybe couldn't get it until Monday account of that , the banks -- But that wasn't really long to wait .",1693
cl08,Not when she'd waited so long already .,1694
cl08,No need say anything at all to the old woman .,1695
cl08,"She had it all planned out , how she'd do .",1696
cl08,"She'd say she didn't feel good on Sunday , couldn't go to church -- there'd be a little argument , but she could be stubborn -- and when the old woman had gone , quick pack the things she'd need to take , all but the dress she'd wear Monday , and take the bag down to that place in the station where you could put things in a locker overnight , for a dime .",1697
cl08,"Then on Monday morning -- or it might have to be Tuesday -- get up and leave just the usual time , and last thing , put the money in an envelope under the old woman's purse there in the drawer .",1698
cl08,"She wouldn't be going to get that for an hour or so after Katya had left , go do the daily shopping .",1699
cl08,"No need leave a note with it , either -- or maybe just something like , Don't worry about me , I'm going away to make a better life .",1700
cl08,A better life .,1701
cl08,Escape .,1702

cl08,He asked her severely .,1721
cl08,"`` A lot of people are so peculiar that they don't like cats , it's not the easiest thing in the world to find good homes for kittens -- and , damn it , you know very well if I have them around long , impossible to give them away !",1722
cl08,"And I suppose now that you've finally grown up , if a little late , you'd go on producing kittens every six months or so .",1723
cl08,"Yes , well , it's a pity to spoil your girlish figure -- which all those kittens would do anyway -- but I think when you've raised these we'll just have the vet fix it so there won't be any more .",1724

ch17,"It is not a medieval mental quirk or an attitude `` unnourished by sense '' to believe that husbands and wives should not be subjected to such a risk , or that such a possibility should not be permitted to endanger the confidentiality of the marriage relationship .",1727
ch17,"While it is easy enough to ridicule Hawkins' pronouncement in Pleas Of The Crown from a metaphysical point of view , the concept of the `` oneness '' of a married couple may reflect an abiding belief that the communion between husband and wife is such that their actions are not always to be regarded by the criminal law as if there were no marriage .",1728
ch17,"By making inroads in the name of law enforcement into the protection which Congress has afforded to the marriage relationship , the Court today continues in the path charted by the recent decision in Wyatt v. United States , 362 U.S. 525 , where the Court held that , under the circumstances of that case , a wife could be compelled to testify against her husband over her objection .",1729
ch17,"One need not waver in his belief in virile law enforcement to insist that there are other things in American life which are also of great importance , and to which even law enforcement must accommodate itself .",1730
ch17,One of these is the solidarity and the confidential relationship of marriage .,1731
ch17,"The Court's opinion dogmatically asserts that the husband-wife conspiracy doctrine does not in fact protect this relationship , and that hence the doctrine `` enthrones an unreality into a rule of law '' .",1732

ch17,Petitioner registered with Local Board No.,1767
ch17,"9 , Boulder , Colorado , on March 17 , 1952 .",1768
ch17,"His answers to the classification questionnaire reflected that he was a minister of Jehovah's Witnesses , employed at night by a sugar producer .",1769
ch17,"He claimed 4-d classification as a minister of religion , devoting a minimum of 100 hours a month to preaching .",1770
ch17,"On November 13 , 1952 , he was classified in Class 1-a .",1771
ch17,"On November 22 , 1952 , he wrote the Board , protesting this classification .",1772
ch17,"He again stated that he was `` a regular minister '' ; ; that he was `` devoting an average of 100 hours a month to actual preaching publicly '' , in addition to 50 to 75 hours in other ministerial duties , and that he opposed war in any form .",1773
ch17,Thereafter he was classified 1-o .,1774
ch17,"On April 1 , 1953 , after some six months of full-time `` pioneering '' , petitioner discontinued devoting 100 hours a month to preaching , but failed to so notify his local board .",1775
ch17,"In a periodic review , the local board on July 30 , 1953 , reclassified him 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner , because of his willingness to kill in defense of his church and home .",1776
ch17,"Upon administrative approval of the reclassification , he was ordered to report for induction on June 11 , 1956 , but failed to do so .",1777
ch17,"He was not prosecuted , however , and his case was subsequently reopened , in the light of Sicurella v. United States , 348 U.S. 385 ( 1955 ) .",1778
ch17,He was again reclassified 1-a by the local board .,1779
ch17,"There followed a customary Department of Justice hearing , at which petitioner appeared .",1780
ch17,"In his report to the Attorney General , the hearing officer suggested that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant training and service .",1781
ch17,"On March 21 , 1957 , however , the Department recommended approval of the 1-a classification .",1782
ch17,"Its ground for this recommendation was that , while petitioner claimed before the local board August 17 , 1956 ( as evidenced by its memorandum in his file of that date ) , that he was devoting 100 hours per month to actual preaching , the headquarters of the Jehovah's Witnesses reported that he was no longer doing so and , on the contrary , had relinquished both his Pioneer and Bible Student Servant positions .",1783
ch17,It reported that he now devoted only some 6-1/2 hours per month to public preaching and from 20 to 25 hours per month to church activities .,1784
ch17,"His claim was therefore `` so highly exaggerated '' , the Department concluded , that it `` cast doubt upon his veracity and , consequently , upon his sincerity and good faith '' .",1785
ch17,The appeal board furnished petitioner a copy of the recommendation .,1786
ch17,"In his answer thereto , he advised the Board that he had made no such statement in 1956 , and asserted that his only claim to `` pioneering '' was in 1952 .",1787
ch17,"The appeal board , however , unanimously concurred in the Department's recommendation .",1788
ch17,"Upon return of the file to the local board , petitioner was again ordered to report for induction and this prosecution followed his failure to do so .",1789
ch17,"Petitioner first contends that the Department denied him procedural due process by not giving him timely opportunity , before its final recommendation to the appeal board , to answer the statement of the local board as to his claim of devoting 100 hours to actual preaching .",1790
ch17,But the statement of the local board attributing this claim to petitioner was in his file .,1791
ch17,"He admitted that he knew it was open to him at all times , and he could have rebutted it before the hearing officer .",1792
ch17,"This he failed to do , asserting that he did not know it to be in his file .",1793
ch17,Apparently he never took the trouble to find out .,1794
ch17,Nevertheless he had ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board .,1795
ch17,"After the recommendation of the Department is forwarded to the appeal board , that is the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge his denial .",1796
ch17,This he did .,1797
ch17,"We found in Gonzales v. United States , supra , that this was the controlling reason why copies of the recommendation should be furnished a registrant .",1798
ch17,"We said there that it was necessary `` that a registrant be given an opportunity to rebut ( the Department's ) recommendation when it comes to the Appeal Board , the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification '' .",1799
ch17,"348 U.S. , at 412 .",1800
ch17,"We fail to see how such procedure resulted in any prejudice to petitioner's contention , which was considered by the appeal board and denied by it .",1801
ch17,"As was said in Gonzales , `` it is the Appeal Board which renders the selective service determination considered ' final ' in the courts , not to be overturned unless there is no basis in fact .",1802
ch17,"Estep v. United States , 327 U.S. 114 '' .",1803
ch17,"348 U. S. , at 412-413 .",1804
ch17,But there are other contentions which might be considered more difficult .,1805
ch17,"At his trial , petitioner sought to secure through subpoena duces tecum the longhand notes of the Department's hearing officer , Evensen , as well as his report thereon .",1806
ch17,Petitioner also claimed at trial the right to inspect the original Federal Bureau of Investigation reports to the Department of Justice .,1807
ch17,He alleged no specific procedural errors or evidence withheld ; ; nor did he elaborate just what favorable evidence the Federal Bureau of Investigation reports might disclose .,1808
ch17,"Section 6(j) of the Act , as we have held , does require the Department's recommendation to be placed in a registrant's file .",1809
ch17,"Gonzales v. United States , supra .",1810
ch17,But there is nothing in the Act requiring the hearing officer's report to be likewise turned over to the registrant .,1811
ch17,"While the regulations formerly required that the hearing officer's report be placed in the registrant's file , this requirement was eliminated in 1952 .",1812
ch17,"Moreover , the hearing officer's report is but intradepartmental , is directed to the Attorney General and , of course , is not the recommendation of the Department .",1813
ch17,"It is not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the Department of Justice , of which the Attorney General receives many , and to which he may give his approval or rejection .",1814
ch17,It is but part of the whole process within the Department that goes into the making of the final recommendation to the appeal board .,1815
ch17,It is also significant that neither this report nor the hearing officer's notes were furnished to the appeal board .,1816
ch17,Hence the petitioner had full opportunity to traverse the only conclusions of the Department on file with the Board .,1817
ch17,Petitioner knew that the Department's recommendation was based not on the hearing officer's report but on the statement of the local board in his file .,1818
ch17,"Having had every opportunity to rebut the finding of the local board before both the hearing officer and the appeal board , petitioner cannot now claim that he was denied due process because he did not succeed .",1819
ch17,It appears to us that the same reasoning applies to the production of the hearing officer's report and notes at the trial .,1820
ch17,"In addition , petitioner has failed to show any particular need for the report and notes .",1821
ch17,"While there are now allegations of the withholding of `` favorable evidence developed at the hearing '' and a denial of a `` full and fair hearing '' , no such claim was made by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process .",1822
ch17,"Moreover , his testimony at trial never developed any such facts .",1823
ch17,"In the light of these circumstances , as well as the fact that the issue at trial in this respect centered entirely on the Department's recommendation , which petitioner repudiated but which both the appeal board and the courts below found supported by the record , we find no relevancy in the hearing officer's report and notes .",1824
ch17,Finally petitioner says that he was entitled to inspect the FBI report during the proceedings before the hearing officer as well as at the trial .,1825
ch17,He did receive a resume of it -- the same that was furnished the appeal board -- and he made no claim of its inaccuracy .,1826
ch17,Even now no such claim is asserted .,1827
ch17,"He bases his present contention on the general right to explore , indicating that he hopes to find some discrepancy in the resume .",1828
ch17,"But this is fully answered by United States v. Nugent , supra .",1829
ch17,"There we held `` that the statutory scheme for review , within the selective service system , entitles [ conscientious objectors ] to no guarantee that the FBI reports must be produced for their inspection '' .",1830
ch17,"346 U.S. , at 5-6 .",1831
ch17,"Even if we were not bound by Nugent , petitioner here would not be entitled to the report .",1832
ch17,"The recommendation of the Department -- as well as the decision of the appeal board -- was based entirely on the local board file , not on an FBI report .",1833
